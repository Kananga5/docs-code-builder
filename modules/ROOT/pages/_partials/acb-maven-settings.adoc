The Apache Maven file `settings.xml` enables you to configure Maven settings, such as repositories, proxy settings, and credentials. For detailed information, see https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Settings Reference^] in the Apache Maven documentation.

To change the default path to your Maven `settings.xml` directory, set the `maven.settings` or `M2_REPO` system property.

To locate `settings.xml`, the IDE first checks for a `maven.settings` configuration. If the property specifies a path, the IDE uses the `settings.xml` file at that path. If `maven.settings` doesn't specify a path or if the file isn't present at that path, the IDE checks for `settings.xml` within the path set by the `M2_REPO` classpath variable (for example, `M2_REPO/settings.xml`). If `settings.xml` isn't found at that path, the IDE creates an empty `settings.xml` file in the default location, `${user.home}/.m2/repository`.

Anypoint Code Builder doesn't make changes to your Maven `settings.xml` file. Instead, when you open the IDE, a separate settings file, `acb_settings.xml` is created in `${user.home}/.m2/repository` if the Anypoint Extension Pack is installed in the IDE. The extension pack is preinstalled in the cloud IDE, but you must install it to the desktop IDE. See xref:start-acb.adoc#set-up-desktop[Set up the Desktop IDE].

Updates that you save to your `settings.xml` are reflected automatically within `acb_settings.xml`. The `acb_settings.xml` is located in `${user.home}/AnypointCodeBuilder/maven`. When troubleshooting a project in Anypoint Code Builder, you can export the file with any sensitive information, such as passwords, obfuscated. To export, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::troubleshooting.adoc#export-troubleshooting-info[Export Troubleshooting Information].
