The Apache Maven file `settings.xml` enables you to configure Maven settings, such as repositories, proxy settings, and credentials. For detailed information, see https://maven.apache.org/settings.html[Settings Reference^] in the Apache Maven documentation.

To change the default path to your Maven `settings.xml` directory, set the `maven.settings` or `$M2_REPO `system property.

To locate `settings.xml`, the IDE first checks for a `maven.settings` configuration. If the property specifies a path, the IDE uses the `settings.xml` file at that path. If `maven.settings` does not specify a path or if the file is not present at that path, the IDE checks for `settings.xml` within the path set by the `M2_REPO` classpath variable (`M2_REPO/settings.xml`). If `settings.xml` is not found at that path, the IDE creates an empty `settings.xml` file in the default location, `${user.home}/.m2/repository`.

Anypoint Code Builder ensures the immutability of your Maven `settings.xml` file by creating a separate settings file, `acb_settings.xml`. This behavior prevents the IDE from changing any of your settings in `settings.xml`. In addition, updates that you make to your `settings.xml` are reflected automatically within `acb_settings.xml`, and when troubleshooting, you can export the file with any sensitive information, such as passwords, obfuscated. To export, see xref:anypoint-code-builder::troubleshooting.adoc#export-troubleshooting-info[Export Troubleshooting Information].
