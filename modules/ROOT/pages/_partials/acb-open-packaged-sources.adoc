//variable used in multiple places on this page:

To import a sharable JAR file in your desktop IDE:

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import a Mule Project
----
. Navigate to the JAR file, and click *Select jar file to import*.
. Navigate to (or create) a folder for the unpacked JAR file contents, and click *Select a folder to work*. 
+
The IDE unpacks the JAR file for your project into the selected folder, which becomes the parent folder for your Mule project folder.
// end::load-sharable-jar[]

// Shared steps for loading the project
// tag::load-project[]
. Open a configuration XML for your project, and launch the UI canvas by clicking the *Show Mule graphical mode* (vertical tree diagram) icon. 
+
image::show-mule-graphical-mode.png["Launch graphical UI with Show Mule graphical mode icon"]
. To monitor progress as the project loads, open the output panel by pressing Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+u (Mac), and select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu in the output panel.
// end::load-project[]

// note at the end of import procedures
// tag::import-note[]

In addition to loading the graphical UI canvas, the IDE also loads dependencies defined in the `pom.xml` for the project. Libraries load to the `target/repositories` directory within the project folder.

// tag::import-project-folder-desktop[]
//variable used in multiple places on this page:

To import a project folder to your desktop IDE:

. In the desktop IDE, navigate to a location for your project folder, such as your home directory:

.. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
----
.. Navigate to and open a parent folder for your project.
. Drag your project directory to the Explorer. For example:
+
image::drag-project-folder.png["Drag Project Folder to Explorer"]
. Select *Copy Folder*.
+
If you instead select *Add Folder to Workspace*, you can start over by selecting the project in the Explorer, right clicking, and then selecting *Remove Folder from Workspace*. After removing, drag and copy the project folder to the IDE without adding it to a workspace. 
// end::import-project-folder-desktop[]
//

//
// tag::open-workspace-dir[]
[[open-directory]]
. Open the workspace at the project's _root_ directory: 

.. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder...
----
.. Navigate to the _root_ directory for your project. 
+
VS Code treats the root as a workspace, which enables the IDE to load the UI canvas properly.
+
The root is the top-level folder that Anypoint Code Builder generates when you create a project. Do not navigate to the projectâ€™s parent or ancestor directory or to one of its child or descendant directories.
