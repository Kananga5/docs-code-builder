// tag::load-sharable-jar[]
//variable used in multiple places on this page:

To import a sharable JAR file in your desktop IDE:

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import a Mule Project
----
. Navigate to the JAR file, and click *Select jar file to import*.
. Navigate to a folder of your choice or create a folder for the unpacked JAR file contents, and click *Select a folder to work*. 
+
The IDE unpacks the JAR file for your project into the selected folder, which becomes the parent folder for your Mule project folder.
. To open the project workspace, navigate to the root directory of the Mule project folder with this command: 
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
----
+
When you open a Mule project at its root, VS Code treats the root as a workspace, which enables the IDE to load the UI canvas properly.
. Open a configuration XML for your project, and launch the UI canvas by clicking the *Show Mule graphical mode* (vertical tree diagram) icon.
+
image::show-mule-graphical-mode.png["Launch graphical UI with Show Mule graphical mode icon"]
. To monitor the process, open the output panel by pressing Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+u (Mac), and select *Mule DX Server*.
+
In addition to loading the graphical UI canvas, the IDE also loads dependencies defined in the `pom.xml` for the project. Libraries load to the `target/repositories` directory within the project folder.

To import a project folder to your desktop IDE:

. In the desktop IDE, navigate to a location for your project folder, such as your home directory:

.. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
----
.. Navigate to and open a parent folder for your project.
. Drag and copy your project directory to the Explorer. For example:
+
image::drag-folder-explorer.png["Add Project Folder to Explorer"]
. If prompted, select *Copy Folder* and _not_ *Add Folder to Workspace*.
+
If you add the folder to a workspace, select the project in the Explorer, and then right click and select *Remove Folder from Workspace*. After removing, drag and copy the project folder to the IDE without adding it to a workspace. 
. Navigate to the root directory of the project folder by using this command: 
+
