= Anypoint Code Builder Generative Flow Release Notes

Welcome to the closed pilot program for Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder Generative Flows. The generative flow feature transforms natural language to Mule flows to help you get started building your integrations. You create a prompt that describes the business logic to implement and submit it to Einstein. Generative flow then transforms your prompt into a Mule flow that you can customize for your specific needs.
