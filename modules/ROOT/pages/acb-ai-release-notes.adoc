= Anypoint Code Builder Generative Flow Release Notes

Anypoint Code Builder includes the generative flow feature, which transforms natural language to Mule flows to help you get started building your integrations. You create a prompt that describes the business logic to implement and submit it to Einstein. Generative flow transforms your prompt into a Mule flow that you can then customize for your specific needs.
