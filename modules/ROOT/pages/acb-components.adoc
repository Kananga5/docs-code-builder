In Anypoint Code Builder, use components to build your integrations and implementations:

* <<builtin-connectors>>
* <<core-processors>>

[[builtin-connectors]]
== Built-In Connectors

Built-in connectors are available from the canvas UI and configuration XML for integrations and implementation project. These connectors include:

* xref:db-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Database] (Database `<db:/>` Connector) 
* xref:email-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Email] (Email `<email:/>` Connector)
* xref:file-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for File] (File `<file:/>` Connector)
* xref:http-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for HTTP] (HTTP `<http:/>` Connector)
* xref:salesforce-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Salesforce] (Salesforce `<salesforce:/>` Connector) 
* xref:sockets-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Sockets] (Sockets `<sockets:/>` Connector) 
* xref:workday-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Workday] (Workday `<workday:/>` Connector) 

Connector XML tags include a namespace followed by an operation, following the syntax `namespace:operation`), such as `<salesforce:create/>`, `<db:insert/>`, `<http:listener/>`, and `<http:request/>`. The namespaces in these cases are `salesforce`, `db`, `http`, and the operations are `create`, `insert`, `listener`, and `request`.

Many other connectors are available through https://www.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Anypoint Exchange (US)^] or https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange (EU)^] from your Anypoint Code Builder IDE.


[[core-processors]]
== Core Processors

Configure message and event processing in an integration application or API implementation. Core processors (also called Mule components) run on the Mule runtime engine.
