In Anypoint Code Builder, use components to build your integrations and implementations:

* <<builtin-connectors>>
* <<core-processors>>

[[builtin-connectors]]
== Built-In Connectors

Anypoint connectors and modules are extensions to Mule runtime engine that aid in processing Mule message and event data within a Mule application, which is what you build through an integration or implementation project. Connectors, unlike modules, also provide ways to connect to external systems or services. 

Built-in Anypoint connectors are available from the canvas UI and configuration XML for integration and implementation projects. These connectors include:

* xref:db-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Database (<db:/>)] (Database Connector)
* xref:email-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Email (<email:/>)] (Email Connector)
* xref:file-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for File (<file:/>)] (File Connector)
* xref:http-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for HTTP (<http:/>)] (HTTP Connector)
* xref:salesforce-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Salesforce (<salesforce:/>)] (Salesforce Connector)
* xref:sockets-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Sockets (<sockets:/>)] (Sockets Connector)
* xref:workday-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for Workday (<workday:/>)] (Workday Connector)

Connector XML tags start with a namespace followed by an operation, following the syntax `namespace:operation`, such as `<db:select/>` for a Select operation in Anypoint Connector for Database (Database Connector).

Many other connectors are available from your Anypoint Code Builder IDE through Anypoint Exchange:

* US cloud (non-EU host): https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange (US)^]
* EU cloud (EU host): https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange (EU)^]

For additional Anypoint connector documentation, see xref:connectors::index.adoc[All Anypoint Connectors and Modules]. 

[[core-processors]]
== Core Processors

Configure message and event processing in an integration application or API implementation. Core processors (also called Mule components) run on the Mule runtime engine.
