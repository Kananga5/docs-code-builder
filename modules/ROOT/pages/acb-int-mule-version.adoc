= Version Settings for Mule, the JDK, and Connectors

Set Mule runtime engine (Mule), JDK, and connector versions to use in your projects.

* Default versions: Set cross-project Mule and JDK defaults from the *Settings* tab in the IDE. 
+
See <<defaults>>.

* Project-level versions: Set versions to use in a specific project.
** For Mule and JDK versions, see <<>>.
** For connector versions, see <<>>.  

[[defaults]]
== Select Default Mule Runtime and JDK Versions

From the *Settings* tab in the IDE, select the default Mule and JDK versions for new implementation and integration projects. You can change the settings for the project. See <<project-mule-jdk-version>>. 

You can set them directly from the command palette for from the *Settings* tab.

To set the defaults from the command palette:

* 


. Navigate to *Manage* (gear icon) > *Settings*. 
+
TODO: Show me how
+
TODO
. In *Settings*, find *Mule â€º Application: Default Mule Runtime And JDK*.
. Set default versions:
+
Although can set the versions manually as values to *muleRuntimeVersion* and *jdkVersion* items, it is easier to set them after clicking *Edit defaults through command palette*.

[[project-mule-jdk-version]]
== Select Mule Runtime and JDK Versions for a Project

Set Mule or JDK versions for a specific implementation or integration project. You can change the versions at any time, but it is important to test your projects with the versions you use. 

These settings are important in several scenarios:

* Updating to a more current version
* Switching to a supported version, for example, for a project that you import into Anypoint Code Builder that uses an unsupported version
* Adding a version of Mule or the JDK that is missing from your project
* Selecting versions of Mule or the JDK that are compatible with each other

When a Mule runtime or JDK version is unset for a project, the IDE's canvas and notifications provide a *Set version* button that opens the *Project Properties* tab. You can also navigate directly to the *Project Properties* tab. 

To select versions for a project:

. Open your implementation or integration project in the IDE.
+
For guidance, see xref:

. Open the *Project Properties* tab using one of these procedures:

* Clicking *Project Properties* from a project's configuration XML in the Explorer. 
+
. Open the project in the IDE.
. Right-click the XML for the project from the Explorer. For example:
+
TODO: ADD IMAGE HERE
. Click *Project Properties*.

* Using a MuleSoft command:
+
. Open the command palette:
+
TODO_SHOWMEHOW
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Project Properties
----
. From *Mule runtime & JDK*, select a Mule runtime and JDK version. For example:
