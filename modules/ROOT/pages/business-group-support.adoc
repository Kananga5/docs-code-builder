Business groups are self-contained resource groups that contain Anypoint Platform resources such as applications and APIs. Business groups provide a way to separate and control access to Anypoint Platform resources because users have access only to the business groups in which they have a role.

Business groups reside within the root organization and are organized in a hierarchical tree where the top-level business group is the root. Each business group you create has one direct parent and can have multiple children.

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to configure the business group in which you want to work.

When you design an API specification or API fragment, select a business group in which you want to create your API:

[IMPORTANT]
--
You canâ€™t change business groups after you create your API specification.

When you implement an API specification, the search filters display the business group form which you want to retrieve your API under the *Organization* column:

Additionally, when importing an asset from Exchange to your Mule application, Anypoint Code Builder displays the business group of that asset.
