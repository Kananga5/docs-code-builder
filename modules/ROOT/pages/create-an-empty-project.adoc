= Create an Empty Project

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to create projects to work on designing API specifications or building Mule applications. A project in Anypoint Code Builder contains a set of files and directories that help you work on your development. Projects also contain information about your API or application such as necessary dependencies or metadata required by Anypoint Exchange to describe your project as an asset.

There are different ways to create a project in Anypoint Code Builder. If you already know what kind of API or application you want to build, you can use specific actions for each type of project:

* See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[] to create a project for an API specification.
* See xref:implement-api-specification.adoc[] to create a project for a Mule application that implements an API specification.
* See xref:develop-integration.adoc[] to create a project for a Mule application that integrates services and enables them to work as one.

Additionally, you can create empty projects to then model as you see necessary.

== Before You Begin

* Ensure you set up your Anypoint Code Builder web IDE. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Anypoint Code Builder saves your projects in your home directory by default. If you choose to use a different directory, ensure that you already created it.
See xref:work-on-home-directory.adoc[] for more information.

== Create a New Project Mule Project

When you choose to create an empty Mule project, Anypoint Code Builder generates the necessary files for a basic Mule project:

. Open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _MuleSoft: Create a Project_.
+
image::create-a-project.png[]
. Select *Mule Project Type*.
+
image::select-mule-project-type.png[]
. Type a name for your Mule project.
+
image::create-project-mule-project-name.png[]
. Select a directory where you want to create your project.
+
image::select-project-location.png[]
. Accept to trust the authors of the files in the directory where you chose to create your project:
+
image::mule-project-trust-authors.png[]
. Anypoint Code Builder creates the base files for your Mule project.

== Create a New API Specification

When you choose to create an empty API specification, Anypoint Code Builder generates the necessary files for an empty API specification:

. Open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _MuleSoft: Create a Project_.
+
image::create-a-project.png[]
. Select *API Specification*.
+
image::create-api-spec-project-name.png[]
. Type a name for your API specification.
+
image::create-api-spec-project-base.png[]
. Select whether you want to create an API specification or an API fragment.
+
image::select-new-api-specification.png[]
. Select the type of API you want to design.
+
image::select-raml-10.png[]
. Select the location of your API specification or fragment.
+
image::select-project-location.png[]
. Accept to trust the authors of the files in the directory where you chose to create your API specification or fragment:
+
image::api-project-trust-authors.png[]
. Anypoint Code Builder creates the base files for your API specification or fragment.
