= Debug a Mule Application

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

You can debug your Mule applcation using the embedded debugger in Anypoint Code Builder

Anypoint Code Builder does not have a hot re-deploy mechanism. To re-deploy a running application that you are debugging:

. Open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _MuleSoft: Rebuild Application_ .

.. *Step Over*: If the line does not contain a `flowref` it behaves the same as next, it takes `flowref` as a unit of process avoiding to stop until return to the current flow.
.. *Step Into*: If the line does not contain a `flowref` it behaves the same as next but if it does the debugger enters the flow referenced.
.. *Step Out*: The debugger goes out of the current flow trying to return to a previous flow. If another flow doesnâ€™t exist, the debugger behaves like *continue*.
.. *Restart*: Not supported.

The following section teaches you how to set up components that help you debug your Mule application, set up breakpoints for your code, and run a debug session.
