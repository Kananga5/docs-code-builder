= Debugging a Mule Application

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

Debug your Mule application using the embedded debugger in Anypoint Code Builder.

// TODO: We may need to link the following sentence with the "deploy-mule-application.adoc" file. If we are to leave this info here, we should more it somewhere else.

Anypoint Code Builder does not have a mechanism for hot redeployments. To redeploy a running application that you are debugging, open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`), and provide the following command:

[source,command]

MuleSoft: Rebuild Application

. *Start Debugging*: Starts the build and runs your Mule application in debug mode.
. *Variables Panel*: Informs you about the Mule event and variables.
. *Watch Panel*: Enables you to evaluate variables and expressions.
. *Call Stack Panel*: Shows the functions or procedures that are currently in the stack.
. *Breakpoints Panel*: Summarizes all the breakpoints in your Mule application.
. *Terminal*: Outputs the Maven build and the results of the deployment to the embedded Mule Runtime engine.

.. *Step Over*: If the line does not contain a `flowref`, it behaves the same as next. It takes `flowref` as a unit of process avoiding to stop until return to the current flow.
.. *Step Into*: If the line does not contain a `flowref`, it behaves the same as next. If the line contains a `flowref`, the debugger enters the flow referenced.
.. *Step Out*: The debugger goes out of the current flow trying to return to a previous flow. If another flow doesnâ€™t exist, the debugger behaves like *continue*.
// TODO: Am I missing something? Where is *continue* explained?
.. *Restart*: Not supported.
// TODO: Can we request assistance from technical team to learn why this feature is not supported now? Will it be supported later?

The following sections explain how to set up components that help debug your Mule application, set up breakpoints for your code, and run a debug session.
