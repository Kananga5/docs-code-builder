A breakpoint enables you to pause your Mule application at a specific place to learn more about what is happening.
// TODO: Kudos for explaining the purpose of adding a component to your flow when debugging it!

== Add a Breakpoint

To add a breakpoint to your Mule application:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, on the Explorer view, open your `interface.xml`.
. Select the *Run and Debug* icon in the activity bar:

. Click next to the line in your `<flow-ref>` component to add a breakpoint on that component.
// TODO: There may be a step missing in the implement-api-interface-logic.adoc file. The `<flow-ref>` is not available for me. I have a <ee:transform doc:name="Transform Message">. Can we add here something like "<flow-ref name="AnotherFlow" />"?

+
NOTE: You can also use `F9` to add a breakpoint to the current line.
. In your `implementation.xml` file, add two more breakpoints for the `<db:select>` and the `<set-variable>` components. Your breakpoints appear in the *Breakpoints* panel:
// TODO: Panel name is always in capital letters both in web IDE and in desktop IDE.

Run your first debug session and inspect the message and variables at different points during application execution.
