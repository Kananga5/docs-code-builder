= Add Breakpoints

A breakpoint enables you to pause your Mule application at a specific place to learn more about what is happening.

== Before You Begin

* You designed an API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* You developed an integration. +
See xref:develop-integration.adoc[].
* You implemented the API. +
See xref:implement-api-specification.adoc[].
* You added components to help your debug. +
See xref:debug-add-logger-set-variables.adoc[].

== Add a Breakpoint

To add a breakpoint to your Mule application:

. In Anypoint Code Builder on your Explorer view, open your `interface.xml`.
. Select the *Run and Debug* icon in the activity bar:

. Click next to the line in your `<flow-ref>` component to add a breakpoint on that component.

[NOTE]
--
You can also use `F9` to add a breakpoint to the line you are standing on.
--
. On your `implementation.xml` file, add two more breakpoints for the `<db:select>` and the `<set-variable>` components.
. Note that all your breakpoints show up in the *Breakpoints* panel:

== Next Step

* xref:run-a-debug-session.adoc[Run a Debug Session]. +
Run your first debug session and inspect the message and variables at different points during your application's execution.
