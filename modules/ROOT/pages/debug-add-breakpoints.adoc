[NOTE]

You can also use `F9` to add a breakpoint to the line you are standing on.
--
. On your `implementation.xml` file, add two more breakpoints for the `<db:select>` and the `<set-variable>` components.
. Note that all your breakpoints show up in the *Breakpoints* panel:

. Proceed to xref:run-a-debug-session.adoc[Run a Debug Session].

Run your first debug session and inspect the message and variables at different points during your application's execution.
