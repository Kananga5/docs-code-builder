// Combine with breakpoints, debug sessions

Debug your Mule application using the embedded debugger in Anypoint Code Builder. 


The process for debugging a Mule app is:

. Set breakpoints to pause the execution of a flow at lines that you want to inspect or fix.
+
Breakpoints are markers that you add on line numbers in a configuration XML file for a Mule application that you are developing.
+
See <<add-breakpoint>>.
. Run the application in debug mode.
// .. Use the *Run and Debug* icon in the activity bar to open *Run and Debug* menu. 
// .. Click *Start Debugging (F5)* icon to start the debugger.
+
See <<run-debug-mode>>.
. Start execution of a flow in your Mule application.
+
For example, trigger an HTTP Listener or configure a Scheduler component.
. When the execution stops at a breakpoint, inspect and fix issues.
. After addressing an issue at a breakpoint, redeploy (_hot deploy_) the running instance of your application.
+
See <<hot-deploy>>.
. Execute your flow again, and continue debugging until you address all issues.

[calloutlist]
. *Start Debugging*: Starts an instance of a Mule application in debugging mode.
. *Debug Toolbar*: Controls debugging of Mule applications.
+
See <<debug-toolbar>>.
. *Variables* panel: Provides Mule event and parameter data.
+
The Mule event includes message payload and attribute details, as well as Mule variable data. The parameters include component data, such as the component name.
. *Run and Debug* (MuleSoft) icon: Opens the *Run and Debug* panel, where you can click *Start Debugging* and find debugging information.
+
Keyboard shortcut: Cmd+Shift+d (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+d (Windows) 
. *Watch* panel: Helps you evaluate variables and expressions.
. *Call Stack* panel: Identifies the functions or procedures that are currently in the stack.
. *Breakpoints* panel: Lists all breakpoints in your Mule application.
. *Terminal* console: Displays the output of the Maven build process and the results of the deployment to the embedded Mule Runtime engine.
. *Breakpoint* icon: Identifies a line in the configuration XML to pause execution of the flow so that you can check for and fix any issues.


[[add-breakpoint]]
== Add a Breakpoint

A breakpoint enables you to pause your Mule application at a specific place to learn more about what is happening.

To add a breakpoint to your Mule application:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, on the Explorer view, open your configuration XML file. For example, `my-project-name.xml`.
. Open the *Run and Debug* panel.
+
.Show me how
[%collapsible]
====
** Click the image:icon-run-debug.png["",15,15] (*Run and Debug*) icon in the activity bar.
** Use the keyboard shortcuts:
+
*** Mac: Cmd+Shift+d
*** Windows: Ctrl+Shift+d
** In the desktop IDE, select *View* > *Run*.
** In the cloud IDE, select *File* > *View* > *Run*.
====

. Click the line number in your `<flow-ref>` component to add a breakpoint on that component.
+
image::deb-add-breakpoint.png[]
+
NOTE: You can also use F9 to add a breakpoint to the current line.
. In your configuration XML file, add two more breakpoints for the `<db:select>` and the `<set-variable>` components.

All breakpoints appear in the *Breakpoints* panel:

[[run-debug-mode]]
== Run Your Application in Debug Mode

After setting up your debug conditions, run a debug session and evaluate your Mule application at each breakpoint:

. Open the *Run and Debug* panel.
+
.Show me how
[%collapsible]
====
** Click the image:icon-run-debug.png["",15,15] (*Run and Debug*) icon in the activity bar.
** Use the keyboard shortcuts:

NOTE: Selecting *Run* > *Start without Debugging* produces an error.

Anypoint Code Builder packages your application and deploys the application to the embedded Mule runtime engine.
A terminal opens so you can view the status.

image::deb-terminal-running.png[]

The terminal displays a message and the status bar turns red to indicate that the application is running.

[calloutlist]
. *Continue* F5
+
Proceeds to the next breakpoint, if present, and pauses execution of the application.
Otherwise, continues to the end of the application.
. *Step Over* F10
+
Proceeds to the next component in the flow, where execution pauses.
At a Flow Ref component (`<flow-ref/>`), clicking *Step Over* proceeds to the next component in the flow but _does not_ follow the Flow Ref logic to a referenced flow or proceed to another flow. 
+
.Step Over Details
[%collapsible]
====
*Configuration XML example*:
[source,xml]
----
<flow name="flow1" doc:name="Flow" >
  <http:listener path="greet" config-ref="HTTP_Listener_config" doc:name="Listener"/>
  <flow-ref name="myNewFlow" /> <!--1-->
  <logger doc:name="Logger1" message="test1"/> <!--2-->
</flow>

<flow name="flow2" doc:name="Flow" >
  <logger doc:name="Logger2" message="test2"/>
</flow>
----
*Step Over behavior*:
[calloutlist]
. Skips `<flow-ref/>` logic
. Reaches `<logger/>` named `Logger1`
====
. *Step Into* F11
+
Proceeds to the next component in the flow, where execution pauses.
At a Flow Ref component (`<flow-ref/>`), clicking *Step Into* follows the logic of the component and proceeds to the first component in the referenced flow. If a component in a flow follows a Flow Ref component, *Step Into* returns to that component after the last component in the referenced flow (or flows).

</flow>

<flow name="myNewFlow" doc:name="Flow" >
  <logger doc:name="Logger2" message="test2"/> <!--2-->
</flow>
----
*Step Into behavior*:
[calloutlist]
. Enters `<flow-ref/>` to follow logic to `myNewFlow`
. Reaches `Logger2` in next flow, `myNewFlow`
. Returns to flow `flow1` to reach `Logger1`
====
. *Step Out* Shift+F11
+
Exits the current flow and attempts to return to a previous flow. If a previous flow doesn't exist, the debugger behaves like *Continue*.
. *Restart* Shift+Cmd+F5 (Mac) or Shift+Ctrl+F5 (Windows)
+ 
Stop and restart the application without packaging new dependencies, such as new connector dependencies in your `pom.xml` file. 
. *Stop* Shift+F5
+
Stop execution of the application. The next debugging session that you start packages the application with any new dependencies.

== Add a Watch Expression

. In the Debug sidebar, in the Watch panel, select the `plus` icon.
+
image::debug-add-expression.png[]
. Add the expression `payload.^mediaType`.
. Select the *Step Over* button until your execution moves to the `<set-payload>` component.
+
Your payload is `application/java`.
. Click *Step Over*  until your execution jumps to the `<logger>` component.
+
Your payload is now `application/json`.
+
image::debuger-watch-expression-json.png[]
. Click *Continue* on your debug toolbar.
+
Note that the application returns the response from the database to your REST client.

[[hot-deploy]]
== Perform a Hot Deploy When Debugging

As you debug your application, periodically perform a hot deployment.
A hot deployment updates a running instance of your application but does not package new dependencies, such as new connector dependencies in your `pom.xml`.

To perform a hot deploy:

. Ensure your Mule application is running in the IDE.
. Make an update to your application.
. Click the *Save and Hot-deploy to Mule Runtime* (lightning) icon to deploy the application with the change.
+
image::deb-hot-deploy.png["Hot-deploy (lightning) icon in a running Mule application"]


[[stop]]
== Stop a Debug Session

To stop your debug session, in the *Run and Debug* panel, click the image:icon-stop.png["",15,15] (*Stop*) icon. 

The status bar no longer indicates that the application is running.

////

[[test]]
== Test Your Application

Use your REST client or a browser to trigger the flow.

. Submit a request.
For example:
+
** For the desktop IDE, submit a URI.
+
[source,URI]
----
http://0.0.0.0:8081/flights
----
** For the cloud IDE, submit a `GET` request to `+https://<web-IDE-instance>/proxy/8081/flights+`. 
+
See xref:ping-locally-deployed-app.adoc[] for guidance with the URI.
. In your REST client or browser, check for the response *Flight info*.
+
If you don't receive this response or if you receive a connection error:
+
.. Review your XML configuration.
.. Make sure your application is deployed.
.. Recheck your HTTP Listener connection.


== Test Your Mule Application

. Make a `GET` request to `+https://<web-IDE-instance>/proxy/8081/api/flights+`. +
See xref:ping-locally-deployed-app.adoc[] for more information about how to send requests to your application.
. In Anypoint Code Builder, notice that the application execution stopped at your first breakpoint.
+
image::debug-stop-at-flow-ref.png[]
. Click *Step Over* on your debug toolbar to move the execution to your next breakpoint.
+
In the Debug sidebar, the *Variables* panel shows details about the Mule event at that particular part of the flow.
+
image::debugger-stop-db-select.png[]
. Select the *Step Over* button on your debug toolbar to move the execution to your next breakpoint.
. In the Debug sidebar on the *Variables* panel, expand the *Mule Message* and the *Payload* variables and note that you can inspect the database response as an array.
