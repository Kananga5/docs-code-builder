= Deploy a Mule Application to CloudHub

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

You can use Anypoint Code Builder to deploy your Mule application to CloudHub.

Anypoint Code Builder can only deploy applications to CloudHub 1.0.

== Before You Begin

Before you begin, ensure that:

* You set up your MuleSoft environment. See xref:configure-mulesoft-environment.adoc[] for more information.
* Your Anypoint Platform user has the necessary permissions to deploy to CloudHub. +
See xref:access-management::permissions-by-product.adoc#runtime-manager[Available Runtime Manager Permissions] for more information.

== Deploy to CloudHub

To deploy an application to CloudHub you must configure a `deploy.json` file in the `src/main/resources` directory of your Mule application project. If your project does not have a `deploy.json` file, Anypoint Code Builder will automatically create one the first time you deploy your application:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your Mule configuration file, and select the *Deploy to CloudHub* icon image:deploy-to-cloudhub-icon.png[20,20].
+

+
Additionally, you can open the Command Palette at any time (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _MuleSoft: Deploy to Cloudhub_.
. If your project does not have a `deploy.json` file created, Anypoint Code Builder prompts that a deployment configuration file has been created and opens it for you to review:
+
[source,json]
--
{
  "runtime": "4.4.0",
  "workerSize": 0.1,
  "applicationName": "my-mule-application", //<1>
  "workers": 1,
  "autoStart": true
}
--
+
[calloutlist]
.. The `applicationName` property defines part of the URL that you use to access your application on Cloudhub. +
The name must be unique across all applications deployed to Cloudhub.
. After reviewing the deployment configuration, select *Deploy* to deploy the application to CloudHub.
+

. Select your preferred environment.
+

+
Anypoint Code Builder packages the application and deploys it to Cloudhub.

After the deployment completes, Anypoint Code Builder enables you to open the application on Runtime Manager.


== Re-deploy to CloudHub

After you deploy a Mule application to CloudHub, you can still modify it and re-deploy it with your new changes. The application that's running on CloudHub will be overwritten.

To re-deploy a Mule application to CloudHub:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your Mule configuration file, and select the *Deploy to CloudHub* icon image:deploy-to-cloudhub-icon.png[20,20].
. If there's already an application with the same `applicationName` already deployed to the same environment on CloudHub, Anypoint Code Builder prompts you to re-deploy the application.

Anypoint Code Builder packages the application and deploys it to Cloudhub.

After the re-deployment completes, Anypoint Code Builder enables you to open the application on Runtime Manager.
