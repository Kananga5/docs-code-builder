* Ensure you set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* You designed an API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* You developed an integration. +
See xref:develop-integration.adoc[].
* You implemented the API. +
See xref:implement-api-specification.adoc[].
* You added components to help your debug. +
See xref:debug-add-logger-set-variables.adoc[].
* You added breakpoints. +
See xref:debug-add-breakpoints.adoc[].
* You ran a debug session. +
See xref:run-a-debug-session.adoc[]
* You installed a REST client like Postman or AdvancedRestClient.

== Deploy the Application to CloudHub

To deploy to Cloudhub you must configure a `deploy.json` file in your `src/main/resources` directory. If your project does not have a `deploy.json` file, Anypoint Code Builder prompts you to create one the first time you deploy your application:

. Open Anypoint Code Builder.
. Open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _MuleSoft: Deploy to Cloudhub_.
+

. Anypoint Code Builder prompts that a deployment configuration file has been created and opens it for you to review:
+
[source,json]
--
{
  "runtime": "4.4.0",
  "workerSize": 0.1,
  "applicationName": "american-ws-anypoint-code-builder", //<1>
  "workers": 1,
  "autoStart": true
}
--
+
[calloutlist]
.. The `applicationName` property defines part of the URL that you use to access your application on Cloudhub. +
The name must be unique across all applications deployed to Cloudhub.
. After reviewing the deployment configuration, select *Deploy* to deploy the application to CloudHub.
+

+
Anypoint Code Builder packages the application and deploys it to Cloudhub.
. After deployment completes, select *Open in Runtime Manager*.
. Select your application from the list applications.
. Note the domain name for your application: +american-ws-anypoint-code-builder.eu-s1.cloudhub.io+.
. Open your preferred REST client and make a `GET` request to +http://american-ws-anypoint-code-builder.eu-s1.cloudhub.io/api/flights+.
