Using Anypoint Code Builder, you can create your own API fragments and publish them to Anypoint Exchange to share with other people,
add fragments from Exchange to your API specification,
or create fragments in your project to add directly to your API specification.

The process for adding a fragment from Exchange is:

. <<add-fragment-to-project,Add the API fragment from Exchange>> to your API spec project as a dependency.
. <<add-fragment-to-spec, Add the API fragment to your API spec>> using the `$ref` or `!include` directives.

You don't need to add a fragment to Exchange to include it in your spec. 
See <<create-add-fragment-directly>>.


== Before You Begin

Before adding fragments:

* xref:setup.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
// * xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create and test your API specification].


== Create an API Fragment and Publish it to Exchange

The process for creating and publishing API fragments is similar to the process for API specifications.

To create an API fragment:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Design an API*.
+
image::design-api-1.png["*Design an API* link highlighted in the *Quick Actions* section"]
. In *Design an API*, click the *API Fragment* tab:
+
image:des-api-fragment.png[API Fragment tab on the Design an API page]
. Complete the *API Fragment* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your fragment.

This name is used as the title and name of the fragment file.
For example, if the project name is "Frag - User", the specification file name is `frag-user`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="proj-directory-warn"]
| *API Specification Language* | See xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc#supported-fragment-languages[Supported Specification Languages for API Fragments].

Select *OAS 3.0* to use the example in this procedure.
| *<Language> Syntax* | The syntax for the selected language.

Select *YAML* to use the example in this procedure.
| *Business Group* | Business Group in Anypoint Platform for your API fragment.

See xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[].

NOTE: You cannot change the selected business group after creating the API fragment.
|===
. Click *Create Project*.
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the folder.
+
When the project is ready for editing, the API fragment project opens in the Explorer view. For example, this OAS 3.0 (YAML) API fragment:
+
image:des-api-fragment-new.png[API Fragment tab on the Design an API page]
. Continue designing your API fragment. 
+
As you enter elements, use xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc#use-autocomplete[auto-complete] (Ctrl+Space) to display available options within the context.
. Follow the steps in xref:des-sync-with-design-center.adoc[] to sync your fragment to Design Center.
. Follow the steps in xref:des-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[] to publish your fragment to Exchange.
+
The status bar shows the progress. When complete, you see a message that the API fragment successfully published to Exchange.
+
Your API fragment appears as an asset in your organization:
For example:
+
image::des-api-frag-exchange.png["API fragment in Exchange"]

[[add-fragment-to-project]]
== Add a Fragment from Exchange to Your Project

To add fragments to the project directory so that you can include them in your specification:

. Open your API specification. For example, `oas-example`.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Enter `mulesoft` and select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Add Fragment dependency from Exchange
----
. If prompted, log in to Anypoint Platform.
. In the *Search for Asset* field, provide the name of the data type asset to add.
+
To search for assets, type the search term and press enter. For example:
+
image::des-add-frag-from-exchange.png["Search for fragment in Assets from Exchange dropdown."]
. Select the fragment from the *Assets From Exchange* menu.
. Select a version of the fragment.
+
The status bar shows the progress. When complete, you see a message that the API fragment was successfully added to the project.
+
* For OAS specs, NEED INFO HERE
* For RAML specs, check that the assets appear in your project's `exchange_modules/` directory. For example: 
+
image:exchange-modules.png[exchange_modules directory]

[[add-fragments-to-spec]]
== Add an API Fragment to Your API Spec


* For OAS specs, use the `$ref` directive.
* For RAML specs, use the `!include` directive.
 

To add fragments to a spec:

. Open your API specification file from the project directory in Explorer.
For example, `oas-example`.
. Depending on the API spec language, specify the directive to add the fragments to your specification.
+
For example, this `!include` directive adds the `AmericanFlight` object from `AmericanFlightDataType.raml` as a data type:
+
[source,RAML]
--
types:
  AmericanFlight: !include exchange_modules/68ef9520-24e9-4cf2-b2f5-620025690913/training-american-flight-data-type/1.0.1/AmericanFlightDataType.raml 
--
+
Anypoint Code Builder auto-completes as you type.


[[create-add-fragment-directly]]
== Create and Add a Fragment Directly in Your Spec

You can create a fragment in your project and include it in your specification.

. In the Explorer, right-click on an empty space, and create a folder named `fragments`.
. In the `fragments` folder, create a new file and add your example code. For example:
+
[source,raml]
--
EXAMPLE OAS FRAGMENT HERE
--
. In your API specification, include the file you just created.
For example:
+
** This directive adds your fragment from the `/examples` folder to a RAML spec:
+
[source,raml]
--
examples:
  output: !include examples/myFrag.raml 
--
** This directive adds your fragment from the `/fragments` folder to an OAS spec:
+
[source,raml]
--
examples:
  output: $ref fragments/myFrag.yaml 
--
