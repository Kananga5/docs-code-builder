= Creating API Specifications

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

Use Anypoint Code Builder to create, test, synch with Design Center, and publish a basic RAML API specification to Exchange:

. <<design-new-api-spec, Create a new API specification project>>.
. <<add-resources-and-methods, Add resources and methods>>.
. <<add-query-params-nested-resources, Add query parameters for your resources>>.
. <<add-nested-resources-methods, Add nested resources and methods>>.
. <<review-spec-console, Review your specification in the API Console>>.

After creating, testing, synchronizing, and publishing your API specification, you can xref:imp-implementing-api-specs.adoc[implement the specification] within an integration.


== Before You Begin

* xref:setup.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Have some familiarity with xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[business groups].
+
API specifications belong to a business group.
* Review the xref:user-guide.adoc[Tutorial] for tips on autocomplete.

[[design-new-api-spec]]
== Create a New API Specification Project

To create a new API specification project:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Design an API*.
. Complete the *API Specification* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project. This name is used as the title and name of the specification file.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create (see xref:work-on-home-directory.adoc[]).
| *API Specification Language* | See xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc#supported-spec-languages[Supported OAS and RAML Versions].
| *Business Group* | Business Group in Anypoint Platform for your API specification.
See xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[].

NOTE: You cannot change the selected business group after creating the API specification.
|===
. Click *Create Project*.

When the project is ready for editing, the API project and specification open in the IDE.

[[add-resources-and-methods]]
== Add Resources and Methods to Your Specification

. xref:configure-default-output-panel.adoc[Open the output panel] to track the progress of internal processing as you design your API.
. In the `<project-name>.raml` file, add your first resource. For example:
+
[source,raml,linenums]
--
#%RAML 1.0
title: My Project

/flights:
--

. Add methods to the resource. For example:
+
[source,raml,linenums]
--
/flights:
  get:
  post:
--

[[add-query-params-nested-resources]]
== Add Query Parameters for Your Resources

In the `<project-name>.raml` file, add query parameters to a method. For example:

[source,raml,linenums]
--
/flights:
  get:
    queryParameters:
      destination:
        required: false
        enum:
          - SFO
          - LAX
          - CLE
--

[[add-nested-resources-methods]]
== Add Nested Resources and Methods

In the `<project-name>.raml` file, add nested resources and methods. For example:

[source,raml,linenums]
--
  post:

  /{ID}:
    get:
--

[[review-spec-console]]
== Review Your Specification in the API Console

. Click the image:icon-api-console.png["",14,14] (*API Console*) icon to display your specification in the console.
. Select methods from the menu in the API Console to view different parts of your specification.
