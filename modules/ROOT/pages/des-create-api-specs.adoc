== Before You Begin

* xref:setup.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Understand the basics of designing API specifications. 
+
See the xref:tutorials.adoc[] for details.
* Have some familiarity with xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[business groups].
+
API specifications belong to a business group.

[[design-new-api-spec]]
== Create a New API Specification Project

To create a new API specification project:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Design an API*.
+
image::design-api-1.png["*Design an API* link highlighted in the *Quick Actions* section"]

. Complete the *API Specification* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the specification file.
For example, if the project name is "OAS Example", the specification file name is `oas-example`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

[IMPORTANT]
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="proj-directory-warn"]
| *API Specification Language* | See xref:des-designing-api-specs.adoc#supported-spec-languages[Supported OAS and RAML Versions].

Select *OAS 3.0 (YAML)* to use the example in this procedure.
| *Business Group* | Business Group in Anypoint Platform for your API specification.

See xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc[].

NOTE: You cannot change the selected business group after creating the API specification.
|===
. Click *Create Project*.
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the folder.
+
When the project is ready for editing, the API project opens the specification in the Editor view.
For example, this OAS 3.0 (YAML) specification:
+
image::des-oas-create.png[New OAS 3.0 (YAML) API Project]
. Continue designing your API specification. 
+
As you enter elements, use <<use-auto-complete, auto-complete>> (Ctrl+Space) to display available options within the context. 

== Example OAS 3.0 (YAML) API Specification 

If you created an OAS 3.0 (YAML) project, replace the initial specification with following example code:

[[use-autocomplete]]
== Use Auto-Complete in the API Editor

. In the editor view, press Ctrl+Space to display available options.
For example:
+
image::des-autocomplete.png[Auto-complete options for `get`]
+
Auto-complete shows different options, depending on the context.
For example:
+
image::des-autocomplete-context.png[Auto-complete options for `responses`]
. Use the arrow keys to navigate the list and click to select.
+
Auto-complete adds the element to the code and places the cursor for you to add values.

[[open-output-panel]]
== Track Progress in the Output Panel

To track the progress of internal processing as you design your API:

// Pointer to Output Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-output-panel"]
. Select *Mule DX Server* from the dropdown:
+
image::des-output-panel.png[Mule DX Server in the output panel]


[[review-spec-console]]
== Review Your Specification in the API Console

To display your specification in the console:

. Click your specification file in the editor.
. Click the image:icon-api-console.png["",14,14] (*API Console*) icon.
. Wait for the endpoints to render in the API Console.
+
The API Console show the endpoints for the specification in API Console.
For example:
+
image::des-api-console.png[API specification in the API Console]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Click a method to view details.
.. Display the console menu.
. Click methods in the console or select items from the menu to view different parts of your specification.
For example, click *GET*:
+
image::des-api-console-detail.png["API Console with Get details"]

[[test-spec]]
== Test Your API Specification Using the Mocking Service

Use the Mocking Service in the API Console to check the request and responses
that you configured in your API specification.

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the specification for your API project, such as `oas-example`.
. Click the image:icon-api-console.png["",14,14] (*API Console*) icon to display your specification in the console.
. In the API Console, click a method, such as GET or POST.
. Click *Try It*.
+
image::des-api-console-try-it.png[Try It button in the API console]
. Verify that the parameters that you've defined are correct and click *Send*.
. Verify that API console returns the response you defined.
For example:
+
image::des-api-console-response.png[Example response in the API console]
. Optionally, review your configured response examples when querying your mocked API endpoints.


[[delete-spec]]
== Delete an API Specification

To delete an API specification:

. In the explorer view, right-click on the folder and select *File > Open Folder*. 
. Locate the folder for the project to delete.
. Right-click and select to delete the folder.
