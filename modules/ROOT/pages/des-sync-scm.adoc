Syncing updates with your source control management system (SCM) is a best practice to ensure that you are able to retain and track your changes to your API design projects. Using an SCM is optional but strongly recommended for projects that you intend to use in a production environment or that you want to store, version, collaborate on, or share with members of your team.

The process for syncing your changes is:

. Review changes to files in your API project since the last sync your SCM.
. Commit and push changes to your SCM.

== Before You Begin

Before syncing with your SCM:

* //TODO: ADD LINK TO HOW TO ON SCM SETUP:
//If your SCM is not configured in VS Code, see xref:TODO.adoc[]. 
* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create and test your API specification].

== Sync Changes with Your Source Control Management System 

. Open your API spec or fragment in Anypoint Code Builder.
// Pointer to Source Control Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-source-control"]
. Review changes by clicking files in the Source Control panel:
+
.. Open a file, for example <<example-oas-api-spec,`oas-example.yaml`>>.
.. Review the working tree and notice the shading for deletions (red) and additions (green):

. Stage changes by clicking the plus icon in the *Source Control* panel:
+
--
** To stage a single file, click the plus icon for that file.
** To stage all changed files, click the plus icon on the *Changes* line.
--
+
The files move to *Staged Changes* section.
+
The UI uses the `git add` command to add changes from your working directory to the staging area.
. Commit staged changes:
+
--
.. In the *Message field*, summarize your changes.
.. Click *Commit*.
--
+
If you staged all files, the *Source Control* panel now displays no changes to commit.
+
The UI uses the `git commit` command to save the changes you staged to your local repository.
. Push your changes by clicking *Sync Changes* in the *Source Control* panel.
+
*Sync Changes* also pulls any changes from your SCM.
+
To push changes without pulling changes:
+
.. In the *Source Control* header, click the *More actions* menu (ellipsis).
.. Select *Push*.
+

+
The UI uses the `git push` command to upload your local content to Git.

//TODO: IS THIS RELEVANT?
If the UI prompts you, indicate whether to check for updates of your API and prompt you to update your local version of the API:
+
//TODO: IS THIS RELEVANT?
