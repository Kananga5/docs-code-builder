To synchronize your API design projects in Anypoint Code Builder with Design Center, you can opt to use the built-in integrated source control management (SCM) in Anypoint Code Builder to upload your API specifications or fragment to Design Center.

The process for syncing with Design Center is:

. Review changes to files in your API project since the last sync with the main branch in Design Center.
. Stage changes from one or more files to the built-in SCM.
. Commit changes to your local repository.
. Push changes to Design Center.

== Before You Begin

Before syncing with Design Center:

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create and test your API specification].

== Configure Anypoint Code Builder to Sync with the Design Center SCM

Before you can synchronize your changes with the Design Center SCM, you must configure the connection.

. Open your API spec or fragment in Anypoint Code Builder.
// Pointer to Source Control Panel

. Review changes by clicking files in the Source Control panel:
+
.. Open a file, for example <<example-oas-api-spec,`oas-example.yaml`>>.
.. Review the working tree and notice the shading for deletions (red) and additions (green):

. Stage changes by clicking the plus icon in the *Source Control* panel:
+
--
** To stage a single file, click the plus icon for that file.
** To stage all changed files, click the plus icon on the *Changes* line.
--
+
The files move to *Staged Changes* section.
+
The UI uses the `git add` command to add changes from your working directory to the staging area.
. Commit staged changes:
+
--
.. In the *Message field*, summarize your changes.
.. Click *Commit*.
--
+
If you staged all files, the *Source Control* panel now displays no changes to commit.
+
The UI uses the `git commit` command to save the changes you staged to your local repository.
. Push your changes to Design Center by clicking *Sync Changes* in the *Source Control* panel.
+
*Sync Changes* also pulls any changes from Design Center.
+
To push changes without pulling changes:
+
.. In the *Source Control* header, click the *More actions* menu (ellipsis).
.. Select *Push*.
+

The UI uses the `git push` command to upload your local content to Design Center.

Your changes are now published in Design Center.

If the UI prompts you, indicate whether to check for updates of your API in Design Center and prompt you to update your local version of the API:
