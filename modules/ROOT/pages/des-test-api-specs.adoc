Use the Mocking Service in the API Console to check the request and responses that you configured for American Flights API in xref:add-request-response-details.adoc[].

== Before You Begin

Before testing an API specification:

* xref:setup.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc[Create an API specification].
// . xref:des-add-examples-to-specs.adoc[Add examples to your specification].


== Test Your API Specification

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the specification for your API project, such as `oas-example`.
. Click the image:icon-api-console.png["",14,14] (*API Console*) icon to display your specification in the console.
. In the API Console, click a method, such as GET or POST.
. Click *Try It*.

. Verify that the parameters that you've defined are correct and click *Send*.
. Verify that API console returns the response you defined.
For example:

. Optionally, review your configured response examples when querying your mocked API endpoints.
