= Creating an API Specification

Create a basic RAML API specification using Anypoint Code Builder.

== Before You Begin

* Ensure you fulfill Anypoint Code Builder requirements. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.

== Create a New API Specification

To create a new API specification:

. In the activity bar, navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view:
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, the "Design an API" section's title is different and the "Help" section has a new title on top ("Documentation").
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
. Select *Design an API*.
+
//TODO: Delete this image and use the previous one. Add numbers next to the arrows to denote steps 1 and 2. 
image::design-api-1.png["*Design an API* link highlighted in the *Getting Started* section"]
+
. Configure your API using the following values:
+
image::design-api-ui-first.png["Project name, Project Location, API Specification Language, and Business Group highlighted in the API Specification tab, in the Design an API window"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. In *Project Name*, enter `*American Flights API*`.
.. In *Project Location* select *Browse*, and then select your home directory.
.. In *API Specification Language* select *RAML 1.0*.
.. In *Business Group* select the business group in which you want to create your API specification.
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
You can't change business groups after you create your API specification.
--
. Select *Create Project*.
//TODO hn: POPUP message: Do you trust the authors of the files in this folder?

The project explorer now shows you your American Flights API folder with an `american-flights-api.raml` file open in the editor.
//TODO hn: There was a delay for me.

== Add a RAML Resource

Start adding resources to your API specification:

. In the editor, add your first resource called *flights*:
+
[source,raml,linenums]
--
#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
--
. Review your new resource using *API Console* by clicking the API Console icon on your API specification editor.
+
//TODO: Consider changing image. The API Console shows "Documentation" as the title instead of the project's name created.
image::flights-endpoint.png["\flights resource highlighted in *API Console*"]
// hn: this is not the case for me. I see the name of the raml file.

// hn: it might be good to have a screenshot of the API Console icon.
// hn: again, the display was delayed and I thought I did something wrong.

== Add a RAML Method

With one resource created, you can add a method to it using autocomplete:

. On a new line after `/flights`, press Tab to indent.
. Press Ctrl+Spacebar to display all the available options.
. Select *get*.

You can add further methods by going to a new line and keep using the autocomplete feature. For example, you can also add the *post* method.

[source,raml,linenums]
--
#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
  get:
  post:
--

Both methods now show on *API Console*.

//TODO: Consider changing image. The API Console shows "Documentation" as the title instead of the project's name created.
image::get-post-methods-api-console.png["GET and POST methods highlighted in *API Console*"]
//TODO hn: this is not the case for me. I see the name of the raml file.

== Add a Nested RAML Resource

You can create nested resources on your API specification and add methods to them:

. Inside the `post:` method, add a nested resource for a flight with a specific ID: `/{ID}`.
. Inside the nested resource `/{ID}`, place a `get:` method.
+
[source,raml,linenums]
--
#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
  get:
  post:

  /{ID}:
    get:
--

The nested resource and its associated method also show up in *API Console*.

//TODO: Consider changing image. The API Console shows "Documentation" as the title instead of the project's name created.
image::sub-methods-api-console.png["/flights/{ID} highlighted in *API Console*]
//TODO hn: this is not the case for me. I see the name of the raml file.

== Add a Query Parameter

Add specific query parameters to your resources:

. In a new line after the `get:` method of your `/flights` resource, use `tab` to indent.
. Press Ctrl+Spacebar to display all the available options.
. Select `queryParameters`.
. On the next line, press Tab to add a new indentation.
// hn: TODO this is automatic for me when I add queryParameters
. Add a new keyword called `destination:`.

#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
  get:
    queryParameters:
      destination:
  post:

  /{ID}:
    get:
--
. Inside the `destination` query parameter, indent the new line and press Ctrl+Spacebar (Windows) or Cmd+Spacebar (Mac) to view the available options.
. Select the `required` parameter, and then press Ctrl+Spacebar (Windows) or Cmd+Spacebar (Mac) and select `false` as the value.
+
[source,raml,linenums]

#%RAML 1.0
title: American Flights API

/flights:
  get:
    queryParameters:
      destination:
        required: false
  post:

  /{ID}:
    get:
--
. On a new line at the same indent level as the `required` parameter, press Ctrl+Spacebar (Windows) or Cmd+Spacebar (Mac) to create an `enum` parameter.
. Inside your `enum` parameter, create values for the enum as `SFO`, `LAX`, and `CLE`.

#%RAML 1.0

/flights:
  get:
    queryParameters:
      destination:
        required: false
        enum:
          - SFO
          - LAX
          - CLE
  post:

  /{ID}:
    get:
