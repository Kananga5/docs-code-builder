= Design an API Specification

You can design a new RAML or OAS API specification using Anypoint Code Builder.

Supported OAS and RAML versions are:

* RAML 1.0
* RAML 0.8
* OAS 2.0 (JSON)
* OAS 2.0 (YAML)
* OAS 3.0 (JSON)
* OAS 3.0 (YAML)

The following section teaches you how to design your first API specification, reuse API fragments from Exchange, test your API using API Console, save your API to Design Center, and finally publish the API as an asset to Exchange.
