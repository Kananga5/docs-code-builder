= Filter Search Results

When implementing an API, Anypoint Code Builder enables you to use advanced search filters to find the API specification you want to work with.


. In your web IDE instance, navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view:

. Select *Implement an API*.

Anypoint Code Builder supports the following filters for your API assets:

* Type +
Types can be:
+
** GraphQL API +
A schema definition that contains the object types and definitions that are used to interact with the API through the GraphQL specification. GraphQL enables you to query an API that supports this language in a much more flexible way than REST.
** REST APIs +
RAML or OAS files that specify APIs referenced by an HTTP Request connector to expose metadata to Anypoint Studio.
+
The list of asset types that display depends on which types are available in a business group.
* Organization +
Business groups that you have permission to view those assets.
* Lifecycle state +
Lifecycle state can be `stable`, `deprecated`, or `development`.
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
Do not use deprecated APIs because those are no longer supported, nor updated.
