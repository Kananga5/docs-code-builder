When implementing an API, use the advanced search filters to find API specifications 
in Exchange.

To search for an API using the search filters:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["Anypoint Code Builder icon highlighted in the activity bar"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Implement an API*.
+
image::implement-api-option-mat.png["Implement an API in the Quick Actions menu"]
. Select *Show Filters* to display the search filters.

+
Anypoint Code Builder supports the following filters for your API assets:
+
* Tag
+
Keyword or term that describes a specific search.
* Type
+
The list of asset types depends on which types are available in a business group, 
such as:
+
** GraphQL API
+
A schema definition that contains the object types and definitions used to interact with the API through the GraphQL specification.
GraphQL enables you to query an API that supports this language in a much more flexible way than REST.
** REST APIs
+
RAML or OAS files that specify APIs referenced by an HTTP Request connector to expose metadata.
+
* Category/Industry
+
Specific groupings of assets set by the administrator of a business group or an organization owner.
* Organization
+
Business groups for which you have permission to view their assets.
+
The search filters display the business group from which to retrieve your API in the *Organization* column:
+

// * Lifecycle state
// +
// Lifecycle state can be `stable`, `deprecated`, or `development`.
// +
// IMPORTANT: Do not use deprecated APIs because those are no longer supported, nor updated.
. Click *Add Asset* to add the selected API specification to the Mule application project.
