Use Anypoint Code Builder implement OAS 2.0 and 3.0 and RAML 0.8 and 1.0 API specifications.

== Before You Begin

. xref:setup.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
. xref:des-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc[Publish your API specification to Exchange].
. xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[Create your integration (Mule app)]


== Implement an API Specification

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]

. From *Quick Actions*, click *Implement an API*.

. Complete the *Implement an API Specification* form.

|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project. This name is used as the title and name of the specification file.
For example, if the project name is "OAS Example", the specification file name is `oas-example`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create (see xref:work-on-home-directory.adoc[]).

| *Show filters* |See xref:filter-search-results.adoc[] for more information.

. In *Search Asset by name*:
+
.. Start typing the name of an API specification that is published to Exchange.
.. Press Enter to display a list of possible results.
.. Click *Add Asset* to select the API specification:

Anypoint Code Builder creates the necessary flows for each endpoint on your API specification endpoints.


== Import an API Specification into an Implementation

If you have already xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[created an integration], you can import your API specification into it:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your integration project in the explorer view. For example, `my-project-name`.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Enter `import` and select the following command:
+
[source,command]
--
MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange
--
. Select *Rest API*.
. If prompted, log in to Anypoint Platform, allowing the extension to sign in and open an external web site and to open Visual Studio Code.
. Type the name of your API specification and press Enter. For example, `OAS Example`.
. Wait for the IDE to load a list of matches to the name:
+
image::imp-assets-from-exchange.png["Assets from Exchange dropdown"]
. At the prompt, select the version of the API to import, such as `v1.0.1`.
. When prompted to scaffold the API dependency, select *Yes*.
+
This step adds the API specification as a dependency in your project's `pom.xml` file
and creates a new configuration XML file, such as `oas-example.xml`:
