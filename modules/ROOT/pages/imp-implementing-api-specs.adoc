Use Anypoint Code Builder to implement an API specification by importing it from 
Anypoint Exchange and scaffolding the specification into an interface
for your integration project (Mule app).

Anypoint Code Builder supports implementing OAS, RAML, and GraphQL API specs.

The methods for implementing API specs using Anypoint Code Builder are:

* xref:imp-implement-api-specs.adoc#implement-api-spec[Implement an API spec] from Exchange and create a new integration project.
* xref:imp-implement-api-specs.adoc#import-spec-into-project[Import an API spec] from Exchange to an existing integration project.
* xref:imp-implement-local-api-specs.adoc[Scaffold an API spec] into an interface project without first publishing it to Anypoint Exchange, enabling iterative design and implementation.
