Use Anypoint Code Builder to implement an API by importing the API spec and scaffolding it into an interface for your integration project (Mule app).

Anypoint Code Builder supports implementing OAS, RAML, and GraphQL APIs.

The methods for implementing APIs using Anypoint Code Builder are:

* xref:imp-implement-apis.adoc#scaffold-new-integration[Scaffold an API from a spec in Exchange] and create a new integration project.
[[import-spec-into-project]]
* xref:imp-implement-apis.adoc#import-spec-into-project[Import an API spec] from Exchange to scaffold the API in an existing integration project.
* xref:imp-implement-local-apis.adoc[Scaffold an API] into an implementation project without first publishing it to Anypoint Exchange, enabling iterative design and implementation.
