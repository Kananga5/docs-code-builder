include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to implement GraphQL API specifications.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that your API specification is published on Exchange.

You can only publish your GraphQL API specification by publishing a new asset on Exchange:

. In Anypoint Platform, navigate to *Exchange*.
. Select *Publish a new asset*.
. Under *Name*, enter a name for your API asset.
. Under *Asset types*, select *GraphQL API*.
. Under *Method*, select *Upload a GraphQL API Schema*.

. Under *Lifecycle*, select the lifecycle status of your API specification.
. Select *Publish*.

[CAUTION]
--
To retrieve private assets from your organization, ensure that you are logged in to Anypoint Platform by verifying that your username shows in the bottom right corner of Anypoint Code Builder:

Anypoint Code Builder creates the necessary flows for each endpoint on your API specification endpoints.

[NOTE]
--
Because GraphQL schemas don't allow examples, Anypoint Code Builder creates empty flows when scaffolding a project based on a GraphQL API.
