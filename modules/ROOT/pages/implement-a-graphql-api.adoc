= Implement a GraphQL API

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

This walkthrough enables you to create a Mule application from scratch that implements a GraphQL API that you published to Exchange.

Before you begin, ensure that you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Downloaded the xref:attachment$books-api.graphql[*Books API* GraphQL schema].

== Publish the GraphQL API to Exchange

You can only implement a GraphQL API that exists in Exchange. Additionally, you can only add a GraphQL API by manually publishing it to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Platform, navigate to *Exchange*.
. Select *Publish a new asset*.
. Under *Name*, type _books-api_.
. Under *Asset types*, select *GraphQL API*.
. Under *Method*, select *Upload a GraphQL API Schema*.
+

+
. Under *File upload*, select *Choose file* and browse your `books-api.graphql` schema file.
. Under *Lifecycle*, select *Stable*.
. Select *Publish*.

== Implement the GraphQL API

. Navigate to Anypoint Code Builder.
. In the Anypoint Code Builder central page, select *Launch webIDE*.
. In the web IDE instance, navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png[]
. Select *Implement an API*.
+
image::implement-api-option-mat.png[]
. Configure your project using the following values:
+
image::implement-api-configure-in-task.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. *Project Name*: _books-implementation_.
.. *Project Location*: select *Browse*, and then select your home directory.
+
image::select-home-directory.png[]
+
.. Search for an API specification published in Exchange to implement. +
Start typing _books_ and hit `enter` to get a list of possible results. Click *Add asset* next to the *books-api.graphql* asset.
+
image::select-books-graphql-api.png[]
+
. Select *Create Project*.

Anypoint Code Builder scaffolds your GraphQL API and creates an empty flow for each type in your Books API GraphQL schema.

Anypoint Code Builder also creates a `<graphql-router:data-fetcher>` as sources for each of your Mule flows. See xref:apikit::apikit-graphql-api-mapping.adoc[] for more information about data fetchers.
