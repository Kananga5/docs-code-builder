This tutorial guides you through creating a Mule application from scratch, implementing a GraphQL API that you publish to Exchange.

Before you begin, ensure that you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Download the xref:attachment$books-api.graphql[*Books API* GraphQL schema].

== Publish the GraphQL API to Exchange

To implement a GraphQL API, the API must first be manually published to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Platform, navigate to *Exchange*.
. Select *Publish new asset*.
. For *Name*, type _books-api_.
. For *Asset types*, select *GraphQL API*.
. For *Method*, select *Upload a GraphQL API Schema*.
+
image::upload-graphql-api-exchange-method-select.png[]
+
. For *File upload*, select *Choose file* and browse for your `books-api.graphql` schema file.
. For *Lifecycle state*, select *Stable*.
. Select *Publish*.

== Implement the GraphQL API

// . Navigate to Anypoint Code Builder.
// . In the Anypoint Code Builder central page, select *Launch webIDE*.
. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and type _MuleSoft: Implement an API Specification_.
+
. Select the command.
+
// . In the web IDE instance, navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view:
// +
//TODO: cc: I wonder if we need this screenshot?
// image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png[]
// . Select *Implement an API*.
// +
//TODO: cc: I wonder if we need this screenshot?
// image::implement-api-option-mat.png[]
. Configure your project using the following values:
+
image::implement-api-configure-in-task.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. *Project Name*: _books-implementation_.
.. *Project Location*: select *Browse*, and then select your home directory.
+
//TODO: cc: I wonder if we need this screenshot? The step seems self-explantory without one. Plus, the screenshot differs from the Desktop IDE UI.
// image::select-home-directory.png[]
+
.. Search for an API specification published in Exchange to implement. +
Start typing _books_ and press Return to display a list of possible results. Click *Add Asset* next to the *books-api* asset.
+
image::select-books-graphql-api.png[]
+
. Select *Create Project*.

// TODO: cc: Desktop IDE prompted me to save a `.code-workspace` file here. Is this correct behavior?
Anypoint Code Builder scaffolds your GraphQL API and creates an empty flow for each type in your Books API GraphQL schema.

Anypoint Code Builder also creates a `<graphql-router:data-fetcher>` as sources for each of your Mule flows. See xref:apikit::apikit-graphql-api-mapping.adoc[] for more information about data fetchers.

Run your application on Anypoint Code Builder and post GraphQL queries to your endpoint.
