= Implement a REST or OAS API Specification

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to implement RAML 0.8, 1.0 and OAS 2.0 and 3.0 API specifications.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that your API specification is published on Exchange.

You can publish your RAML or OAS API specification to exchange using different methods:

* Manually upload your API specification files by publishing a new asset on Exchange. +
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/exchange/to-create-an-asset#create-an-api-asset[Create an API Asset^].
* Publish your API specification from Anypoint Studio. +
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/studio/7.14/publish-api-project-to-exchange[Publish an API Project to Exchange^]
* Publish your API specification using Anypoint CLI. +
See https://docs.mulesoft.com/anypoint-cli/4.x/exchange-assets#exchange-asset-upload[Exchange Assets^].
