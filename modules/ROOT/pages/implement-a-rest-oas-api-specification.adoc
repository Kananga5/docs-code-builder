include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to implement RAML 0.8, 1.0 and OAS 2.0 and 3.0 API specifications.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that your API specification is published on Exchange.

You can publish your RAML or OAS API specification to exchange using different methods:

* Manually publish your API specification files by publishing a new asset on Exchange. +
See xref:exchange::to-create-an-asset.adoc#create-an-api-asset[Create an API Asset].
* Publish your API specification from Anypoint Studio. +
See xref:studio::publish-api-project-to-exchange.adoc[Publish an API Project to Exchange]
* Publish your API specification using Anypoint CLI. +
See xref:anypoint-cli::exchange-assets.adoc#exchange-asset-upload[Exchange Assets].
