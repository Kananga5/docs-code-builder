= Implement a REST or OAS API Specification

You can use Anypoint Code Builder to implement a RAML, OAS, or GraphQL API specification. Implementing an API specification means that you can import the specification as a dependency, and create a Mule application that adds logic to each endpoint.

Before getting started, ensure that your API specification is published on Exchange.

[CAUTION]
--
You can only publish your GraphQL API specification by publishing a new asset on Exchange. See xref:implement-a-graphql-api-specification.adoc[]
