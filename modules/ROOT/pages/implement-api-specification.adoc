You can use Anypoint Code Builder to implement a RAML or OAS API specification. Implementing an API specification means that you can import the specification as a dependency, and create a Mule application that adds logic to each endpoint.

The following section teaches you how to import your API specification from Exchange, scaffold flows for your API endpoints, and define the logic for each flow of your Mule application.

Start by xref:import-api-specification-from-exchange.adoc[Importing Your Flights API From Exchange].
