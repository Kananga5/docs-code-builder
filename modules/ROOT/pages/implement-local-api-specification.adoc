= Implement a Local API Specification

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to scaffold an API specification into a Mule project without publishing it to Anypoint Exchange. If you edit the API specification, re-scaffold it to reflect the changes in the Mule project.

Both API design and API implementation tasks are now synchronized. You can then publish your API specification and deploy your Mule project.

When you are designing an API specification, click the *Implement this local API* icon to scaffold your current API specification into a new Mule project:

Code Builder creates a workspace with both the API specification and Mule project and keeps them synchronized.

Optionally, you can open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+P (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+P (Mac) and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement this Local API
----

After the API specification and the related Mule project are synced, you can modify the API specification and implement changes simultaneously.

By iterating between the API design and implementation tasks you can speed up the development process.

== Working Iteratively Between an API Specification and a Mule Project

To implement a local API:

. Open an API specification. +
You can either import an API from Design Center or design a new API specification.
. Click the *Implement this local API* icon.
+
Code Builder creates a multi-root workspace to keep your API specification and Mule project in sync. +
A multi-root workspace enables you to work with both your API specification and Mule project folders at the same time.
+
After creating the workspace, Code Builder packages the API specification and publishes it to a local Maven repository as a snapshot.
. Choose a location to store your workspace. +
The multi-root workspace is a file with the `.code-workspace` extension that keeps both of your directories coordinated.
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
Save the `.code-workspace` file in your home directory. Do not save it inside the API specification folder.
--
. Choose a project name for your Mule project.
. Choose a location for your Mule project.
+
Code Builder then scaffolds your current local API specification into a new Mule project.

You can now start iterating between your API specification and its related Mule project.

Every time you modify an API specification, you can run a *Re-Scaffold this local API* command to update the  Mule project based on the changes in the Mule application. For example, if you add a new endpoint to an API specification, Code Builder scaffolds a new flow for that endpoint.

To close your multi-root workspace, run the *Workspaces: Close Workspace* command. 

To re-open the synchronized project, open the workspace you created when you started implementing your local API.
