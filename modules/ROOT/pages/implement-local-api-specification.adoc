= Implement a Local API Specification

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to scaffold your API specification into a Mule project without having to publish it to Exchange. You can work on your Mule project, then edit the API specification, and re-scaffold it to reflect your new changes. Both API design and API implementation tasks are now synchronized. You can then publish your API specification and deploy your Mule project from there.

When you are designing an API specification, run the *Implement Local API* command to scaffold your current API specification into a new Mule project. Code Builder creates a workspace with both your API specification and Mule project, and keeps them synchronized.

With your API specification and related Mule project in sync, you can now modify your API specification and implement your changes simultaneously. Iterating between your API design and implementation tasks, you can speed up your development process.
