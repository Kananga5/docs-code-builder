= Import a DataWeave Library

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

Anypoint Code Builder enables you to import DataWeave libraries from Exchange into your Mule application.

A DataWeave library is a reusable package of DataWeave modules and mapping files, and resource files, such as JSON, XML, and CSV.
//NOTE: Definition taken from https://beta.docs.mulesoft.com/beta-dataweave/dataweave/2.4/dataweave-extension-plugin#developing-dataweave-libraries

You can import a DataWeave library the same way you import any other asset from Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange_.
+

. Select *DataWeave Library*.

. Start typing the name of the DataWeave library you need, and hit `enter` for Anypoint Code Builder to suggest the assets that match your search.
. Select the DataWeave library you need.
. Select the version of the DataWeave library you want to import.

Anypoint Code Builder displays a message indicating that the dependency was successfully added.
