= Creating Integrations Using Generative Flows

The Generative Flow feature transforms your natural language prompt, which describes your business logic, into a flow, containing the connectors and components needed to accomplish the specified task. 

For example, if you want to create a flow that reads contacts from Salesforce in JSON format, you can enter a prompt describing that task. The prompt is then transformed into a series of connectors and processors that are needed to execute that task, in this case: `Listener`, `Query`, `Transformer`, and `Logger`. A flow is generated, which you can then further customize to suit your needs. 


== Before You Begin

Before you start creating your integration using Generative Flows:

* Ensure that you have the following permissions:
** Anypoint Code Builder Developer
** Mule Developer Generative AI User
+
If you see the *Start with AI* card in the canvas when you start building a new integration, you have the correct permissions.
* Install a REST client such as Postman or Advanced REST Client.

| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the integration specification file.
For example, if the project name is "My Integration", the name of the folder for the integration project is `my-integration-app`, and the configuration XML file name is `my-integration-app.xml`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create. Click *Browse* to select a directory for the integration if you don't want to use the default.

. Click *Create Project*.

The flow builder canvas appears with two cards:

//Is that called the flow builder canvas or...? Should we have an image that shows the two cards? Placeholder image.
