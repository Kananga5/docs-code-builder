= Creating Integrations Using Generative Flows

The Generative Flow feature transforms your natural language prompt, which describes your business logic, into a flow, containing the connectors and components needed to accomplish the specified task. 

For example, if you want to create a flow that reads contacts from Salesforce in JSON format, you can enter a prompt describing that task. The prompt is then transformed into a series of connectors and processors that are needed to execute that task, in this case: `Listener`, `Query`, `Transformer`, and `Logger`. A flow is generated, which you can then further customize to suit your needs. 


== Before You Begin

Before you start creating your integration using Generative Flows:

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* Ensure that you have the following permissions to use the Generative Flow feature:
** Anypoint Code Builder Developer
** Mule Developer Generative AI User
+
If you see the *Start with AI* card in the canvas when you start building a new integration, you have the correct permissions.
* Install a REST client such as Postman or Advanced REST Client.

== Create a New Integration Project

To create a new integration project:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Develop an Integration*:

. Complete the *Develop an Integration* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the integration specification file.
For example, if the project name is "My Integration", the name of the folder for the integration project is `my-integration-app`, and the configuration XML file name is `my-integration-app.xml`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create. Click *Browse* to select a directory for the integration if you don't want to use the default.
|===
+
. Click *Create Project*.

The flow builder canvas appears with two cards:

//Is that called the flow builder canvas or...? Should we have an image that shows the two cards? Placeholder image.

You can either:

* Click *Open Einsten* in the *Start with AI* card to use the generative flow feature.
* Click the *Build a flow* in the *Start From Scratch* card to begin building your flow from scratch.

== Add a Flow to Your Project

Use the Generaive Flow feature to add a flow to your project.

. In the *Start with AI* card, click *Open Einstein*.
+
Optionally, click on either of the example prompts on the *Start with AI* card to get an idea of how this feature works.
. If this is the first time you are using this feature, agree to the terms, and continue. 
The *Einstein* panel opens.
+

+
. Enter the prompt to create the initial flow for your task and click the send icon.
+
Optionally, you can click on one of the supplied prompts to get started.
+
While your flow is being generated, you see the message `Einstein is thinking` in the prompt box.
+
When your flow is ready, the code and a description of the components of the flow appear in the *Einstein* panel. 
+

. Optionally, click the thumbs up or thumbs down icon that appears after the generated code. 
+
//I made this up. Does this work this way?

Rating the flow that's created for you helps Einstein learn so that over time, the generated flows improve.
. Inspect the generated code, and if you are satisfied, click the insert code icon to insert the code in to your flow. 

//probably need screenshot

. After the code is inserted, the initial flow is built and the visual representation of the flow is displayed in the canvas next to the XML code tab. 


== Customize Your Flow

Generative Flow builds the initial flow for you so that all you need to do is fill in the information that's specific to your configuration.
