Create a basic integration, add connectors and other components to your Mule application
to process your business logic, and configure attributes:

. <<create-integration-project, Create an integration project>>.
+
Create the integration from scratch, or start from a template or example that you import from Anypoint Exchange. For information about templates and examples in Exchange, see xref:exchange::asset-types.adoc[].
. <<add-components, Add components to your project>>.
. <<import-connectors-from-exchange, Import connectors from Exchange>>.
. <<configure-attributes, Configure attributes for a component>>.
. <<check-connection, Test an HTTP Listener connection>>.
. <<create-new-config, Create a new XML configuration file>>.


== Before You Begin

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].

[[create-integration-project]]
== Create an Integration Project

To create an integration project:

// Open the ACB IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
. From *Quick Actions*, click *Develop an Integration*:
+
image::develop-integration-option-mat.png["Develop an Integration link highlighted in the Getting started section"]
. Complete the *Develop an Integration* form.
+
[%header,cols="20a,60a"] 
|===
| Field Name | Field Value

| *Project Name* | Unique name for your project.

This name is used as the title and name of the integration project file.
For example, if the project name is "OAS Integration," the project file name is `oas-integration`.
| *Project Location* | Your home directory or another directory you create. Click *Browse* to select a different directory for the integration.

See xref:start-add-folders.adoc[].

include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="proj-directory-warn"]
|===
. Opt to create a project from scratch or to start with an asset from Anypoint Exchange:

* *Empty Project*
+
Start an integration project from scratch, without any preconfigured components.
+
image::int-create-integration-scratch.png["Create integration project from scratch.", width=70%]

* *Template or Example Project*
+
Import an existing integration template or example from Anypoint Exchange. 
+
image::int-create-integration.png["Create integration project from an Exchange asset."]
+
If you opt to start with an asset from Exchange:

.. xref:start-acb.adoc#login-ide[Log in to Anypoint Platform from the IDE] so that you can find assets.
.. From the IDE, search for the template or example. 
+
Partial searches are accepted.
.. Mouse over the asset that you want to add.
.. Click *Add Asset*. 
. Click *Create Project*.
+
When you create an integration project from scratch or if your project from Exchange does not contain a flow structure (Flow, Subflow, or Error handling component), the canvas UI provides the option to create one. Otherwise, the canvas UI generates a graphical representation of the imported asset's components that you can use to start your configuration.

[[add-components]]
== Add a Component to Your Project

Add components to your project from the canvas UI. 

This example assumes that you are starting from an empty integration project to which you add a Flow component with an HTTP listener from Anypoint Connector for HTTP (HTTP Connector), Set Payload, and a Logger component. When you add the listener, Anypoint Code Builder adds a dependency for the HTTP Connector to the project's `pom.xml` and a namespace for the connector to the configuration XML.

. In the Explorer view, select the XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`. 
+
image::int-empty-canvas.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Mule flow and the Mule configuration file"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. The canvas provides space for a visual representation of your Mule flows or subflows.
.. The configuration XML editor displays the configuration file for your Mule application.
. Select *Build a Flow* from the canvas to create an empty flow within a Mule integration application.
. Change the default name of the flow by using one of these procedures:

* In the canvas UI, click *Flow name1* to open the configuration UI for the flow, change the flow name, and click the check mark to set the new name. 
+
image::int-flow-name-ui.png["Change name of flow through canvas UI."]
* In the configuration XML, replace the default name of the flow (`name1`) with your flow name, such as `getFlights`.
+
[source,xml]
----
<flow name="getFlights" >
    
</flow>
----

. Add a component to your project from the canvas, for example, add the HTTP Listener component:
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, search for and select *Listener* from the *HTTP* results:
+
image::main-tutorial-add-first-listener.png["Listener component highlighted in the Add Component section"]
+
The configuration XML file now includes the XML for the HTTP Listener into the `<flow/>` element, for example:
+
[source,XML]
----
<flow name="getFlights" >
  <http:listener path="path" config-ref="config-ref" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="rrjiqa" />

</flow>
----
. Add another component, this time using the XML configuration menu.
For example, add the `<http:listener-config/>` component from a snippet.
+
For more information about snippets, see xref:int-work-with-code-snippets.adoc[].
+
.. In the configuration XML, place your cursor before the opening `<flow>` tag, and type `http`.
+
Ensure that the cursor is not inside the `<flow/>` element.
+
.. Type `http`, and select the `http:listener-config` snippet:
+
image::add-http-config-snippet.png["http:listener-config snippet highlighted in the configuration XML menu"]
+
The snippet adds the following code:
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>
----
. Add another component to your flow.
+
For example, add a Set Payload component to your HTTP Listener operation:
+
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, search for and select *Set payload* from the *Transformer* results.
.. In the canvas, click *Set payload* to open its configuration UI, and add a value between the square brackets that appear (`#[]`):

* To add a string, type a value, such as `my value`, for example:
+
image::int-set-payload-config-string.png["Adding string to Set Payload"]

* To add a DataWeave expression or a Mule variable as a value, such as `payload`, click *fx* above the field, and provide the value, for example:
+
image::int-set-payload-config-fx.png["Adding expression to Set Payload"]

Your configuration XML file now looks similar to the following:

[source,xml]
--
<http:listener-config name="HTTP_Listener_config" >
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081" />
</http:listener-config>

<flow name="getFlights" >
  <http:listener path="path" config-ref="config-ref" doc:name="Listener" doc:id="rrjiqa" />
  <set-payload value="my value" doc:name="Set payload" doc:id="gecykt" />
    
</flow>
--

Notice that the Listener component in the canvas now shows an error:

image::int-canvas-error.png["Listener error in the canvas"]

To determine where the error is, select the processor in the canvas.
Anypoint Code Builder highlights its location within the configuration XML, and you can mouse over the issue for more information, for example:

image::int-select-listener-config.png["Selecting configuration reference from configuration UI"]

To fix the error, configure the attributes properly. For example, to correct the mismatched `config-ref` value for the HTTP listener, select the reference name from the drop-down menu in the component's configuration UI, or type the correct attribute value directly within the XML. 

For more information about debugging, see xref:debugging-mule-apps.adoc[].

[[import-connectors-from-exchange]]
== Import a Connector from Exchange

Anypoint Connectors provide operations for retrieving, modifying, and sending data to and from systems.
In addition to the xref:acb-components.adoc#builtin-connectors[built-in connectors] that Anypoint Code Builder provides,
you can download many other connectors from Anypoint Exchange.

To import a connector from Exchange and add it to your configuration:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the UI canvas if it doesn't open automatically.
. Add the connector the same way you added other components from the canvas:
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the *Add Component* panel, click *Connectors*.
.. Click the connector name and then click the operation to add, such as *Publish*:
+
image::int-add-connector-operation.png["Add Publish operation from the Anypoint MQ Connector"]
+
If the connector is not available locally, click the image:icon-search-exchange.png["",15,15] (*Search in Exchange*) toggle:
+
image::int-connector-search-exchange.png["Search in Exchange toggle"]
+
--
[calloutlist]
. Search locally
. Search in Exchange
--
.. Select the connector to add to your project.
.. Select the operation from the *Add Component* panel.


To import a connector from Exchange to use later in your project:

. In the Explorer view, open the configuration XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
. Click the image:icon-tree-view.png["",15,15] (*Show Mule graphical mode*) icon in the activity bar to open the canvas UI if it doesn't open automatically.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange
----
. Select *Connector*.
. Search for the connector name to import, such as "MQ", for example:
+
image::int-import-connect-exchange.png["Import MQ Connector from Exchange]
. Select the connector.
. At the prompt, select the version of the connector to import, such as `v4.0.3`.
+
Anypoint Code Builder imports the connector and makes it available in the Components list.

For more information about the connectors available on Exchange, see 
xref:connectors::index.adoc[]. 
For more information about Exchange, see 
https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange (US)^] or
https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/exchange/[Exchange (EU)^]
and
xref:exchange::index.adoc[].


[[configure-attributes]]
== Configure Attributes for a Component

After you add the components to the project, configure the attributes. 

For example, configure these attributes for the `<http:listener-config/>`,  `<http:listener/>`, and `<set-payload/>` elements:

[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="inbound-request" doc:name="Listener Config" doc:id="b5c62f-a84a3a"> 
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081"/> 
</http:listener-config>

<flow name="getFlights">
    <http:listener path="flights" config-ref="inbound-request" doc:name="HTTP /flights" doc:id="htprur" />
    <set-payload value="Flight info" doc:name="Set Response" doc:id="e43e98-1a9a01"/>
</flow>
----

[[check-connection]]
== Test an HTTP Listener Connection

To test an HTTP Listener connection, click *Test Connection* in the configuration XML:

image::http-listener-test-connection.png["HTTP Listener Test Connection link in the configuration XML"]

The status bar shows the progress:

* *Verifying connection inbound-request* indicates that the test is in progress.
* *Connection is valid* indicates a successful connection. 
* *Invalid Connection Got status code: 500 when trying to resolve a Mule Runtime operation* indicates a connection error.
+
A common code `500` error is `port 8081: Address already in use`. For port conflicts, configure a different port, such as `8082`, and retest the connection. 

Before publishing, run your application in debug mode.


[[create-new-config]]
== Create an Additional Configuration XML File

Anypoint Code Builder creates the initial Mule configuration XML file in `src/main/mule` within the Mule project.

You can create additional configuration files, for example, for an implementation file for a scaffolded interface or for global configurations that you can reference from an XML file. 

To create a new configuration XML file:

. In the Explorer view, right-click the *mule* folder (`src/main/mule`) and select *New Mule Configuration File...*.
. In the *New Mule Configuration File...* field that opens, provide a name for the new file without an extension.
+
image::int-add-config-xml.png["Provide name of Mule configuration XML file"]
+
The name must be unique within the project. Permitted special characters are `_` (underscore), `-` (hyphen), `.`, `@`, `(`, and `)`.
+
The process automatically appends an `xml` extension to the file name and opens the new configuration XML file and its canvas UI within the IDE. The new configuration XML file contains the `<mule/>` element with default namespaces:
+
[source,xml]
--
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<mule xmlns="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core" 
      xmlns:doc="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/documentation"
      xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
      xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core http://www.mulesoft.org/schema/mule/core/current/mule.xsd">
  
</mule>
--
+
The file's canvas UI provides the same options for building your project file that appear when you create an integration project. For an example and to get started with your configuration, see <<add-components, Add a Component to Your Project>>.
