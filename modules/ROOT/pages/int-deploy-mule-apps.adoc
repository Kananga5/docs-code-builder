You can use Anypoint Code Builder to deploy your Mule application to CloudHub.

NOTE: Anypoint Code Builder can deploy applications only to CloudHub 1.0.


== Before You Begin

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[Create an integration].
* Install a REST client, such as Postman or AdvancedRestClient.

== Deploy an App to CloudHub

To deploy an application to CloudHub, you must configure a `deploy.json` file in your `src/main/resources` directory.
If your project does not have a `deploy.json` file, Anypoint Code Builder prompts you to create one the first time you deploy your application.

To deploy your app to CloudHub:

// Open IDE
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-ide"]
. Open and place your cursor in the configuration XML file in a project for the Mule app to deploy.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
--
MuleSoft: Deploy to CloudHub
--
. If prompted, click *Allow* to allow sign in using Anypoint Platform and select the business group.
+
If the project doesn't already have a `deploy.json` file, Anypoint Code Builder prompts that a deployment configuration file has been created and opens it for you to review.
For example:
+
image::int-deploy-json-desktop.png["Review deploy.json file"]
+
The `applicationName` property defines part of the URL that you use to access your application on CloudHub.
+
This name must be unique across all applications deployed to CloudHub.
. After reviewing the deployment configuration, click *Deploy* to deploy the application to CloudHub.
. At the prompt, select the environment to deploy to.
+
Anypoint Code Builder packages the application and deploys it to CloudHub.
The Output panel opens with *Mule Maven Output* selected:
+
image::int-deploy-output.png["Output panel with Mule Maven Output selected"]
. After deployment completes, click *Open in Runtime Manager*.
+
Your app opens in Runtime Manager in Anypoint Platform.
+
Note the domain name for your application.
The domain name of the application varies, but it follows a similar structure such as: `app-with-100-schedulers.us-w1.cloudhub.io`.
. Open your preferred REST client and make a `GET` request to the domain name as 
displayed in Runtime Manager.
+
For example, `+http://app-with-100-schedulers.us-w1.cloudhub.io/api/flights+`.
