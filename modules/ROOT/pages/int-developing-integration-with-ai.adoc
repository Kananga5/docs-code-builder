= Developing Integrations Using Einstein

include::partial$acb-ide-logos.adoc[tags="both-ides"]

Use Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder Generative Flows (Einstein) to jumpstart your integration development by using natural language prompts to generate your flows. The engine for these generative flows are the pre-trained large language models (LLM) that are natively and securely embedded within Salesforce. The Salesforce LLMs are at the core of the Generative AI capabilities in Anypoint Code Builder. 

== Trust Layer

The Einstein trust layer bridges Anypoint Platform and the Salesforce native LLMs, as shown in the following flow:

[calloutlist]
. The Anypoint Code Builder user crafts a prompt based on their use case and sends it to Einstein.  
. To avoid the "hallucination" effect, MuleSoft proprietary data grounds prompts.
. The prompt is sent to Open AI via the secure gateway to ensure the data is sent safely to the external LLM. 
. Zero data is retained outside of Salesforce.  
. After a response is generated, it is sent back through the secure gateway.
. MuleSoft validates the generated output to make sure that the flow works within the MuleSoft ecosystem. 
. The prompt and generated responses are logged for monitoring before surfacing the validated response in Anypoint Code Builder.

[IMPORTANT]
This feature uses generative AI, which is known to include inaccurate or harmful responses. Before implementing this feature, review the output for accuracy and safety. You assume responsibility for the output when making business decisions.
