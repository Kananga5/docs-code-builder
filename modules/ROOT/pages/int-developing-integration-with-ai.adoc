= Devloping an Integration Using Einstein

include::partial$acb-ide-logos.adoc[tags="both-ides"]

Use Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder: Generative Flows (Einstein) to jumpstart your integration development by using natural language prompts to generate your flows. The engine for these generative flows is the pre-trained large language model (LLM) that is natively embedded within Salesforce. These LLMs are the heart of Generative AI capabilities in Anypoint Code Builder. 

This feature transforms your natural language prompt into the order of components needed to accomplish a task. For instance, suppose a developer wanted a flow that reads contacts from Salesforce in a JSON format. This feature will mark the beginning of the development process by transforming such a prompt into a series of connectors and processors that will be needed to execute that task: [‘Listener’, ‘Query’, ‘Transformer’, ‘Logger’]. In doing so, our developers will never have to start from scratch because they have a template they can further configure for their specific needs. 


== Trust Layer

The Einstein trust layer bridges our platform and the Salesforce native LLMs.

Anypoint Code Builder user sends prompt to Einstein. 

MuleSoft proprietary data grounds the prompts before sending them to Open AI via the gateway. 

MuleSoft ensures that prompts are sent securely and safely to these external LLMs, and that there is Zero data retained outside of Salesforce. 

After a response is generated, it is sent back through the gateway, and MuleSoft does a validity check to make sure that the flows work with the MuleSoft ecosystem. 

The prompt and generated responses are logged for monitoring before surfacing the validated response in Anypoint Code Builder.
