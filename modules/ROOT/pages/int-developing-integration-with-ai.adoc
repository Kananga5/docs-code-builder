= Developing Integrations Using Einstein

include::partial$acb-ide-logos.adoc[tags="both-ides"]

Use Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder: Generative Flows (Einstein) to jumpstart your integration development by using natural language prompts to generate your flows. The engine for these generative flows is the pre-trained large language model (LLM) that is natively embedded within Salesforce. These LLMs are at the core of Generative AI capabilities in Anypoint Code Builder. 

== Trust Layer

The Einstein trust layer bridges Anypoint Platform and the Salesforce native LLMs.

[calloutlist]
. Anypoint Code Builder user sends prompt to Einstein. 
. MuleSoft proprietary data grounds the prompts before sending them to Open AI via the gateway. 
. MuleSoft ensures that prompts are sent securely and safely to these external LLMs, and that there is Zero data retained outside of Salesforce. 
. After a response is generated, it is sent back through the gateway, and MuleSoft does a validity check to make sure that the flows work with the MuleSoft ecosystem. 
. The prompt and generated responses are logged for monitoring before surfacing the validated response in Anypoint Code Builder.

[IMPORTANT]
This feature uses generative AI, which is known to include inaccurate or harmful responses. Before implementing this feature, review the output for accuracy and safety. You assume responsibility for the output when making business decisions.
