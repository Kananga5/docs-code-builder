= Devloping an Integration Using Einstein

include::partial$acb-ide-logos.adoc[tags="both-ides"]

Use Einstein for Anypoint Code Builder: Generative Flows (Einstein) to jumpstart your integration development by using natural language prompts to generate your flows. The engine for these generative flows is the pre-trained large language model (LLM) that is natively embedded within Salesforce. These LLMs are at the core of Generative AI capabilities in Anypoint Code Builder. 

Generative Flows transform your natural language prompts into a flow that includes the required components, in the correct order needed to accomplish your task. For instance, if you want to create a flow that reads contacts from Salesforce in a JSON format, enter your prompt in a natural language format, for example, "I want to create a flow that will read my Salesforce contacts in a JSON format." Generative Flow transforms your prompt into a series of connectors and processors that are needed to execute that task: ‘Listener’, ‘Query’, ‘Transformer’, and ‘Logger’. 


== Trust Layer

The Einstein trust layer bridges our platform and the Salesforce native LLMs.

Anypoint Code Builder user sends prompt to Einstein. 

MuleSoft proprietary data grounds what does that mean the prompts before sending them to Open AI via the gateway. 

//I don't know what grounding is. 

MuleSoft ensures that prompts are sent securely and safely to these external LLMs, and that there is Zero data retained outside of Salesforce. 

After a response is generated, it is sent back through the gateway, and MuleSoft does a validity check to make sure that the flows work with the MuleSoft ecosystem. 

The prompt and generated responses are logged for monitoring before surfacing the validated response in Anypoint Code Builder.
