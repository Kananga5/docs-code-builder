Anypoint Code Builder enables you to import DataWeave libraries from Exchange into your Mule application.

A DataWeave library is a reusable package of DataWeave modules and mapping files, and resource files, such as JSON, XML, and CSV.

You can import a DataWeave library the same way you import any other asset from Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Import Asset from Exchange
----
+
image::import-asset-exchange-implementation.png[]
. Select *DataWeave Library*.
+
image::add-dw-library-from-exchange.png[]
. Start typing the name of the DataWeave library you need, and press Enter for Anypoint Code Builder to suggest the assets that match your search, such as *DataWeave*:
+
image::acb-dw-libraries.png[]
. Select the DataWeave library.
. Select the version of the DataWeave library to import.

Anypoint Code Builder displays a message indicating that the dependency was successfully added.
