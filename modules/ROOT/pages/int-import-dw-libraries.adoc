Use Anypoint Code Builder to import DataWeave libraries from Exchange into your Mule application.

A DataWeave library is a reusable package of DataWeave modules and mapping files, and resource files, such as JSON, XML, and CSV.

. Enter `import` and select the following command:
+
[source,command]
--

. Select *DataWeave Library*.

To search for a library, type the search term and press enter. For example, enter *DataWeave*:
+
image::int-dw-libraries.png["Search for DataWeave libraries"]
. Select the DataWeave library from the *Assets From Exchange* menu.
. Select a version of the DataWeave library.
+
The status bar shows the progress.

When complete, Anypoint Code Builder shows a message that the dependency was successfully added to the project.
