Import a project JAR file or folder into a workspace in your IDE. A project directory contains a Mule application for an integration or implementation. 

////
Visual Studio Code treats a directory as a workspace. To open a project folder for a Mule application into a VS Code workspace, open the project's root directory. If the project is part of a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[multi-root workspace^], open the project from the workspace. 
////

To _export_ a JAR file that packages a project with resources from your application, see xref:package-mule-application.adoc[].

If you encounter an import issue, check for workarounds in xref:acb-release-notes.adoc#import-issues[Known Issues] in the Anypoint Code Builder Release Notes or in xref:troubleshooting.adoc[].



== Before You Begin

* xref:setup.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[Create an integration].
* Close any open project in your IDE:
+
From the Explorer, select the *File* > *Close Folder* (desktop IDE) or menu icon > *File* > *Close Folder* (cloud IDE).
+
NOTE: Never open or unpack a project folder within another project folder.

//H2: DESKTOP
[[import-desktop]]
== Import and Open a Project in the Desktop IDE

Use the desktop IDE to upload a project directory or sharable JAR file into a project workspace. 

* <<desktop-project-package>>
* <<desktop-project-folder>>

[[desktop-project-package]]
=== Import a Sharable Project JAR File into the Desktop IDE

Import a sharable JAR file for a snapshot of a Mule project into the desktop IDE. Shareable JAR files are generated through the process described in xref:package-mule-application.adoc#sharable[Package a Project in a Sharable JAR File]. The contents are lightweight because they lack dependencies. The IDE generates the dependencies configured in the `pom.xml` for the project. 

To import a sharable JAR file in your desktop IDE:

// include for this procedure
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-sharable-jar"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="open-workspace-root"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-project"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="import-note"]

[[desktop-project-folder]]
=== Import a Project Folder into the Desktop IDE

Though it is more common to import a sharable JAR file, you can also drag a sharable Mule project folder into the Explorer and open the project in a VS Code workspace.

To import a project folder to your desktop IDE:

include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="import-project-folder-desktop"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="open-workspace-root"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-project"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="import-note"]

[[desktop-open-project-folder]]
=== Open a Project Workspace from the Desktop IDE

Open or reopen a project workspace for your application.

// include for this procedure
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="open-workspace-root"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-project"]

//H2: WEB
[[import-web]]
== Import and Open a Project in the Cloud IDE

The cloud IDE enables you to upload a project directory or JAR file into a workspace.

* <<web-project-package>>
* <<web-project-folder>>


//WEB: PACKAGED PROJECT TO WORKSPACE
[[web-project-package]]
=== Import a Sharable Project JAR File into the Cloud IDE

Import a JAR file for a Mule project and load the unpacked project into a workspace in the IDE.

//includes first 2 steps, shared cloud steps
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="preliminary-cloud-import-steps"]
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the directory.
. After Anypoint Code Builder loads your directory, drag your JAR file to your Explorer view:
+
image::upload-jar-file.png["Upload a JAR file in the Explorer"]

* If prompted, trust the authors of your file or directory.
* _Do not click_ *Open Anyway* in response to this warning in the IDE: _This file is not displayed in the text editor because it is a binary or uses an unsupported encoding._
+
If the file is large, Anypoint Code Builder displays the upload progress on the bottom left side of your screen:
+
image::upload-progress.png["Upload progress in the status pane"]
+
You can expand the progress bar by clicking it:
+
image::upload-progress-expanded.png["Expanded progress bar"]

[[use-dw-imported-project]]
== Use DataWeave with Imported Projects

To use DataWeave in an imported project, a `mule-service-weave-ee` dependency must be configured in your project `pom.xml` file, for example:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.services</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-service-weave-ee</artifactId>
  <version>2.4.0-20220824</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
----
