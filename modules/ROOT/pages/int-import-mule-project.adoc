Import a project JAR file or folder into a workspace in your IDE.
A project directory contains a Mule application for an integration or implementation. 

////
Visual Studio Code treats a directory as a workspace. To open a project folder for a Mule application into a VS Code workspace, open the project's root directory. If the project is part of a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[multi-root workspace^], open the project from the workspace. 
////

To _export_ a JAR file that packages a project with resources from your application, see xref:int-export-mule-project.adoc[].

If you encounter an import issue, check for workarounds in xref:acb-release-notes.adoc#import-issues[Known Issues] in the Anypoint Code Builder Release Notes or in xref:troubleshooting.adoc[].

IMPORTANT: Never open or unpack a project folder within another project folder.

//H2: DESKTOP
[[import-desktop]]
== Import and Open a Project in the Desktop IDE

Use the desktop IDE to upload a project directory or sharable JAR file into a project workspace. 

* <<desktop-project-package>>
* <<desktop-project-folder>>
* <<both-open-project-folder>>


[[desktop-project-package]]
=== Import a Sharable Project JAR File into the Desktop IDE

Import a sharable JAR file for a snapshot of a Mule project into the desktop IDE.

To create a shareable JAR file, see xref:int-export-mule-project.adoc#sharable[Export to a Shareable JAR File].
The contents are lightweight because they don't include dependencies.
The IDE generates the dependencies configured in the `pom.xml` for the project. 

To import a sharable JAR file in your desktop IDE:

. Ensure that no project is open in the IDE.
// include for this procedure
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="open-command-palette-desktop"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-sharable-jar"]
. If your Mule project folder is closed, <<both-open-project-folder, open a workspace>> for the project at the project's _root_ directory.

include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="import-note"]



[[desktop-project-folder]]
=== Import a Project Folder into the Desktop IDE

Although it is more common to import a sharable JAR file, you can also drag a sharable Mule project folder
into the Explorer view and open the project in a VS Code workspace.

To import a project folder to the desktop IDE:

. Ensure that no project is open in the IDE.
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="import-project-folder-desktop"]
. If your Mule project folder is closed, <<both-open-project-folder, open a workspace>> for the project at the project's _root_ directory.

//H2: WEB
[[import-web]]
== Import and Open a Project in the Cloud IDE

The cloud IDE enables you to upload a project directory or JAR file into a workspace.

* <<web-project-package>>
* <<web-project-folder>>
* <<both-open-project-folder>>


//WEB: PACKAGED PROJECT TO WORKSPACE
[[web-project-package]]
=== Import a Sharable Project JAR File into the Cloud IDE

Import a JAR file for a Mule project and load the unpacked project into a workspace in the IDE.

. Ensure that no project is open in the cloud IDE.
//includes first 2 steps, shared cloud steps
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="preliminary-cloud-import-steps"]
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the directory.
+
Anypoint Code Builder loads your directory.
. Drag your shareable JAR file from your computer to the Explorer view in the cloud IDE.
For example:
+
image::int-drag-jar-cloud.png["Drag a JAR file to the Explorer view in the cloud IDE"]
+
If prompted, trust the authors of your file or directory.
+
IMPORTANT: Do not click *Open Anyway* in response to this warning in the IDE: `This file is not displayed in the text editor because it is either binary or uses an unsupported encoding.`
+
If the imported folder is large, Anypoint Code Builder displays an upload progress bar that you can click to expand.
//last steps:
// include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-sharable-jar"]
// Different in cloud.

. Navigate to and select the shareable JAR file to import.
. Navigate to a folder to which to unpack the JAR file, such as your home directory or any folder _outside_ of a Mule project folder, and click *OK*.
+
The IDE unpacks the shareable JAR file for your project into the selected folder.
. If your Mule project folder is closed, <<both-open-project-folder, open a workspace>> for the project at the project's _root_ directory.

//WEB: PROJECT FOLDER TO WORKSPACE
[[web-project-folder]]
=== Import a Project Folder into the Cloud IDE

. Ensure that no project is open in the cloud IDE.
//includes first 2 steps, shared cloud steps
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="preliminary-cloud-import-steps"]
+
If prompted, trust the authors of the files in the directory.
+
Anypoint Code Builder loads your directory.
. Drag your project folder from your computer to the Explorer view in the cloud IDE.
For example:
+
image::int-drag-folder-cloud.png["Drag a project folder to the Explorer view in the cloud IDE"]
+
If prompted, trust the authors of your file or directory.

If the imported folder is large, Anypoint Code Builder displays an upload progress bar that you can click to expand.
. If your Mule project folder is closed, <<both-open-project-folder, open a workspace>> for the project at the project's _root_ directory.

[[both-open-project-folder]]
== Open a Project Workspace from the Desktop or Cloud IDE

Open or reopen a project workspace for your application.

// include for this procedure
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="open-workspace-root"]
include::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tags="load-project"]


[[use-dw-imported-project]]
== Use DataWeave with Imported Projects

To use DataWeave in an imported project, you must configure a `mule-service-weave-ee` dependency in your project `pom.xml` file.
For example:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.services</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-service-weave-ee</artifactId>
  <version>2.4.0-20220824</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
