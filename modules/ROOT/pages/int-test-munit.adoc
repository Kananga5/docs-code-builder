Run, modify, and create MUnit suites and tests for your implementation and integration projects in Anypoint Code Builder. Import projects that contain MUnit test files. MUnit suites contain a set of MUnit tests for Mule applications. 

MUnit is a MuleSoft unit testing framework for creating and running unit tests on a Mule application, as described in xref:munit::index.adoc[MUnit Overview]. 

Anypoint Code Builder - MUnit Extension, part of the Anypoint Extension Pack, supports MUnit functionality in Anypoint Code Builder. For  information about extensions, see xref:index.adoc#extension-pack[Anypoint Extension Pack].
//TODO: IS MAVEN PACKAGED OR DO THEY NEED TO INSTALL IT? 
//TODO: ADD MAVEN VERSION MINIMUM TO 

NOTE::MUnit tests in Anypoint Code Builder are configurable from the XML but not from the canvas. 

== Import a Project that Contains MUnit Tests

Mule projects created in Anypoint Studio and Anypoint Code Builder for your integrations or implementations can include MUnit tests. 

. Import and open the project into Anypoint Code Builder. 
+
For guidance see, xref:int-import-mule-project.adoc[]. 
+
To export a project from Anypoint Studio before importing to Anypoint Code Builder, use one of the procedures in xref:studio:import-export-packages.adoc#export-project-studio[Export Projects From Studio]. 
. Locate the tests in the project.
+
See <<view-tests>>.

== Run an MUnit Test or Test Suite

Anypoint Code Builder provides a Testing panel from which you can run tests. In the Explorer, test suites are also located within the project directory `/src/test/munit`.

Run tests using any of these options:

* <<run-test-panel>>
* <<run-test-xml>>
* <<run-test-explorer>>
* <<run-test-debugger>>

While tests run, the Terminal tab in the output panel displays the progress of the each test's execution, and the Testing 

[[run-test-panel]]
=== Run Tests from the Testing Panel

Run all tests, all tests in a suite, or a single test from the Testing panel. The Testing panel lists all MUnit test suites in the project.

To run tests:

. Open a project that contains an MUnit test suite.
. From the activity bar, click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-testing.png["",18,18] (Testing) icon to open the Testing panel.
+
If the icon is not present, try right-clicking within the activity bar and selecting *Testing* to display the icon. 
. Run tests from the Testing panel at any of three levels:
+

[calloutlist]
. All suites: Run all tests in all suites by clicking the *Run Tests* or *Debug Tests* icon.
. Suite: Run all tests in a single suite by hovering over or clicking the suite, and then clicking the *Run Test* or *Debug Test* icon.
. Test: Run a single test by hovering over or clicking a test in a test suite, and then clicking the *Run Test* or *Debug Test* icon.

== Open Test XML

Open the test suite XML from the Explorer or from the Testing panel.

* From the Explorer:

.. Click the image:anypoint-code-builder::icon-munit-testing.png["",18,18] (Testing) icon to open the Testing panel.
.. Click or mouse over the suite or test name, and click the (Go to test) icon to open the file that contains the test. 
+
If you click the test name, the file focuses on the test's XML configuration. 
 

* From the Testing panel:


** Click the test's Run button in the Testing panel:

//TODO: VERIFY TERM "output panel" since there is an Output tab, so term seems partial
While tests run, the Terminal tab in the output panel displays the progress of the each test's execution. 

After running, the Test Results tab in the output panel provides the following information:

* Status of the tests that run:
** ERROR
** FAILURE
** IGNORED
** SUCCESS

* Summary
//TODO: VERIFY ALL
** `Total number of tests to execute`: The number of tests in any suites that you selected to run. For example, if you run a single suite with 7 tests, the total is 7. If you run 3 suites with 4 tests each, the number is 12.
** `Total number of tests to execute`: The number of tests that completed their execution. Tests that fail to finish running are omitted from this total. For example, if a test throws an uncaught exception, then the execution terminates before the test completes. 
** For tests that complete execution, results include the following totals:
*** `Total number of tests passed`:

No further action is required.
*** `Total number of tests failed with errors`:
