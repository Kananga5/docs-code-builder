When an integration that you are developing builds successfully, the application deploys within your development environment, whether on your desktop or the cloud-based host for your Anypoint Code Builder applications. 

It is common to configure an HTTP Listener to trigger the execution of a flow in your deployed application through a URL. The URLs to use for the desktop and cloud IDEs differ for deployments to your development environment in Anypoint Code Builder:

* In the desktop IDE, a URI configured for the listener, such as `+http://localhost:8081/some-endpoint+`, works if no other applications are using that port. 
+
Add `/api` to the URI for a listener in a scaffolded interface that you generate when implementing an API specification in the IDE, for example:
`+http://localhost:8081/api/some-endpoint+`.

* In the cloud IDE, your development environment is hosted remotely, so you must configure a URL to a proxy for your application's host. 
+
For guidance constructing the URL in the cloud IDE, see:

** <<ping-browser>> 
** <<ping-rest-client>>

[[ping-browser]]
== Ping a Locally Deployed Application on the Cloud IDE Using a Browser

. Open the Mule project that you want to test and navigate to *Run* > *Start Debugging* (`F5`).
. After your application deploys successfully, open a new tab in your browser.
. Type the URL of your cloud IDE instance, add the `/proxy/` path, and then add the port number you configured as a new path:
`+https://<web-IDE-instance>/api/<port-you-configured-on-your-listener>/+`
+
For example:
+
[source]
--
https://lavender-ndm0yl.builder.code.com/proxy/8081/
--
+
See xref:manage-web-ide-instance.adoc[] to ensure that you are using the correct instance URL.
. When pinging that URL, the cloud IDE triggers the Mule flow.

[[ping-rest-client]]
== Ping a Locally Deployed Application on the Cloud IDE Using a REST Client

. Open the cloud IDE using your browser's Developer Tools (`F12`).
. Navigate to your *Application* tab.
. Under *Storage*, expand the *Cookies* section and select the URL of your cloud IDE instance.
. Search for the term _proxysession_:
+

. Copy the cookie name and value. For example:
+
[source]
--
proxysession5f5648c7115f4e2e8f3f9396355ac4e8-0=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
--
+
[NOTE]
--
The `proxysession` cookie name varies depending on the user.
--
. In the cloud IDE, open the Mule project that you want to test and navigate to *Run* > *Start Debugging* (`F5`).
. After your application deploys successfully, open your preferred REST client application.
. Type the URL of your cloud IDE instance in the request URL section, add the `/proxy/` path, and then add the port number you configured as a new path:
`+https://<web-IDE-instance>/api/<port-you-configured-on-your-listener>/+`
+
For example:
+
[source]
--
https://lavender-ndm0yl.builder.code.com/proxy/8081/
--
+
See xref:manage-web-ide-instance.adoc[] to ensure that you are using the correct instance URL.
. Configure the headers to send the necessary cookies that you copied earlier:
+
image::send-request-with-cookies.png[]
. When pinging that URL, the cloud IDE triggers the Mule flow.
