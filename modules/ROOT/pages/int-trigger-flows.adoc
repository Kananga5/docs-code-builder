When an integration or implementation that you are developing builds successfully within the Anypoint Code Builder IDE, the application deploys within your development environment, whether on your desktop or the cloud-based host for your applications.  

It is common to configure the HTTP Listener from  xref:http-connector::index.adoc[Anypoint Connector for HTTP] (HTTP Connector) to trigger the execution of a flow in a deployed application. You can trigger the flow from the built-in terminal in Anypoint Code Builder, from a REST client, or from your browser.

[[before-you-begin]]
== Before You Begin

* Complete xref:start-acb.adoc[] for your IDE.
* Make sure an integration or implementation project with an HTTP Listener (`<http:listener/>`) is available from the cloud or desktop IDE.
+
To create a project, see xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[] or xref:imp-implementing-apis.adoc[], or follow the procedures in the tutorial xref:tut-af-amflights-overview.adoc[].

== Integrations Versus Implementations

An important difference between integration and implementation projects is that the interface for implementations is typically generated through an automated scaffolding process that generates an HTTP Listener for triggering a flow in your application, as indicated in the American Flights tutorial, in xref:tut-af-implement-am-flights-api.adoc#endpoint[Configure an Endpoint through the Interface]. 

Typically, local deployments within the IDE are configured to trigger the localhost at `0.0.0.0` and port `8081` or similar (such as `8082` if `8081` is currently in use by another application). 

The URL to use for triggering the HTTP Listener in a scaffolded interface generated from an API specification differs slightly from an integration project that does not implement a scaffolded interface. 

* Desktop IDE example for an integration project _without_ a scaffolded interface to trigger a locally deployed endpoint: 
+
----
http://0.0.0.0:8081/some-endpoint
----
+
Notice the configuration in the `<http:listener-connection/>` element:
+
[source,xml]
----
<http:listener-config name="inbound-request" 
      doc:name="Listener Config" doc:id="b5c62f">
  <http:listener-connection host="0.0.0.0" port="8081"/>
</http:listener-config>
<flow name="getFlights">
    <http:listener path="flights" config-ref="inbound-request" doc:name="HTTP /flights" />
    ...
</flow>
----
* Desktop IDE example for an implementation or integration project _with_ a scaffolded interface to trigger a locally deployed endpoint: 
+
----
http://0.0.0.0:8081/api/some-endpoint
----
+
Notice that the URL adds `api/` to the URL to make the request trigger the `<http:listener/>`. This listener is located before the router (`<apikit:router/>`) in the scaffolded interface within the configuration XML. Notice the automatically set attribute `path="/api/*"` in the listener's XML:
+
[source,xml]
----
<apikit:config name="american-flight-api-config" 
               api="resource::bc64acc7-41ad-43b7-9e0a-092182b03271:American-Flight-API:1.0.0:raml:zip:american-flight-api.raml" 
               outboundHeadersMapName="outboundHeaders"  
               httpStatusVarName="httpStatus" />
<flow name="american-flight-api-main">
    <http:listener config-ref="inbound-request" path="/api/*">
        <http:response statusCode="#[vars.httpStatus default 200]">
            <http:headers>#[vars.outboundHeaders default {}]</http:headers>
        </http:response>
        <http:error-response statusCode="#[vars.httpStatus default 500]">
            <http:body>#[payload]</http:body>
            <http:headers>#[vars.outboundHeaders default {}]</http:headers>
        </http:error-response>
    </http:listener>
    <apikit:router config-ref="american-flight-api-config" />
    ...
</flow>
----

////
Another difference the desktop and cloud IDEs differ for deployments to your development environment in Anypoint Code Builder:

* In the desktop IDE, a URI configured for the listener, such as `+http://localhost:8081/some-endpoint+`, works if no other applications are using that port. 
+
Add `/api` to the URI for a listener in a scaffolded interface that you generate when implementing an API specification in the IDE, for example:
`+http://localhost:8081/api/some-endpoint+`.

* In the cloud IDE, your development environment is hosted remotely, so you must configure a URL to a proxy for your application's host. 
+
For guidance constructing the URL in the cloud IDE, see:

** <<ping-rest-client>>

== Trigger Locally Deployed Apps in Cloud IDEs and Desktop IDEs

After meeting the prerequisites in <<before-you-begin>>, trigger a integration or implementation application that is deployed locally within the cloud or desktop IDE:


* <<terminal>>
* <<browser>>
* <<rest-client>>

[[terminal]]
=== Trigger a Flow from the Terminal

Use the Terminal in Anypoint Code Builder to trigger a flow through an HTTP Listener in an integration or implementation project.

//first generic steps
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-run-debug"]
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="deploy-locally"]
+
Make sure that the application deploys successfully with the `DEPLOYED` log message in the output panel:
+
[souce,output panel]
----
**********************************************************************
*              - - + DOMAIN + - -               * - - + STATUS + - - *
**********************************************************************
* default                                       * DEPLOYED           *
**********************************************************************
----
//open terminal
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
//next steps:
. In the terminal, click the name of the shell to use in the terminal, such as `bash` or `zsh`. 
+
Alternatively, you can click the *+* icon in the terminal to open an new command prompt.
. At the command prompt, provide a `curl` command to trigger the flow, for example:
+
----
$ curl 0.0.0.0:8081/mypath \n
----
+
The `\n` forces the command to place the response on a separate line without a trailing command prompt.
+
If successful, the command returns a response. 

[[browser]]
=== Trigger a Flow from Your Browser

Use your browser to trigger a flow through an HTTP Listener in an integration or implementation project.

[[rest-client]]
=== Trigger a Flow from Your REST Client

Use a REST client to trigger a flow through an HTTP Listener in an integration or implementation project.

[[ping-browser]]
== Trigger a Locally Deployed Application on the Cloud IDE Using a Browser

. Open the Mule project that you want to test and navigate to *Run* > *Start Debugging* (`F5`).
. After your application deploys successfully, open a new tab in your browser.
. Type the URL of your cloud IDE instance, add the `/proxy/` path, and then add the port number you configured as a new path:
`+https://<web-IDE-instance>/api/<port-you-configured-on-your-listener>/+`
+
For example:
+
[source]
--
https://lavender-ndm0yl.builder.code.com/proxy/8081/
--
+
See xref:manage-web-ide-instance.adoc[] to ensure that you are using the correct instance URL.
. When pinging that URL, the cloud IDE triggers the Mule flow.

==================
. Open the cloud IDE using your browser's Developer Tools (`F12`).
. Navigate to your *Application* tab.
. Under *Storage*, expand the *Cookies* section and select the URL of your cloud IDE instance.
. Search for the term _proxysession_:
+
image::application-storage-cookies.png[]
. Copy the cookie name and value. For example:
+
[source]
--
proxysession5f5648c7115f4e2e8f3f9396355ac4e8-0=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
--
+
[NOTE]
--
The `proxysession` cookie name varies depending on the user.
--
. In the cloud IDE, open the Mule project that you want to test and navigate to *Run* > *Start Debugging* (`F5`).
. After your application deploys successfully, open your preferred REST client application.
. Type the URL of your cloud IDE instance in the request URL section, add the `/proxy/` path, and then add the port number you configured as a new path:
`+https://<web-IDE-instance>/api/<port-you-configured-on-your-listener>/+`
+
For example:
+
[source]
--
https://lavender-ndm0yl.builder.code.com/proxy/8081/
--
+
See xref:manage-web-ide-instance.adoc[] to ensure that you are using the correct instance URL.
. Configure the headers to send the necessary cookies that you copied earlier:
+
image::send-request-with-cookies.png[]
. When pinging that URL, the cloud IDE triggers the Mule flow.
