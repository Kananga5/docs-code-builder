= Learn the UI Elements

Anypoint Code Builder features a simple layout that maximizes space to edit your APIs and integrations.

The UI is divided into five areas:

. *Activity Bar*: Located on the far left side, the Activity Bar enables you to switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when the source control management is enabled.
. *Editor*: The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like side by side vertically and horizontally.
. *Panels*: You can display different panels below the editor region for output or debug information, errors and warnings, or an integrated terminal.
. *Status Bar*: Information about the opened project and the files you edit.
. *Side Bar*: Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your Mule project.
