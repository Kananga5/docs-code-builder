. *Activity Bar*: Located on the far left side, the Activity Bar enables you to switch between views and gives you additional context-specific indicators, like the number of outgoing changes when you've enabled source control management.
. *Editor*: The main area to edit your files. You can open as many editors as you like and arrange them side by side, as well as vertically and horizontally.
. *Panels*: You can display different panels below the editor to see output and debug information and errors and warnings, or to use the integrated terminal.
. *Status Bar*: Displays information about the opened project and the files you edit.
. *Side Bar*: Contains different views like the Explorer to assist you while working on your Mule project.
