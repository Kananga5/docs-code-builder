Anypoint Code Builder enables you to scaffold an API specification into the configuration XML for Mule project without first publishing the specification to Anypoint Exchange. For example, if you add a new endpoint to your API specification, Anypoint Code Builder is able to scaffold a new flow for that endpoint through the command `MuleSoft: Implement this local API`.

////
TODO duke: TBD: INTEGRATE THIS INFO? 
Implementing a local API enables you to reflect your changes to your API design directly into the Mule project that implements your API specification.

You can close your multi-root workspace by running the Workspaces: Close Worspace command. You can re-open your synchronized project by opening the workspace your created when you started implementing your local API.
////

== Before You Begin

Set up your MuleSoft environment. See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information. 

== Create an API Specification in a New VS Code Window

[[avoid-issue]]
//anchor for link from first step to this intro
Iterative API design and implementation within the IDE requires a multi-root workspace in VS Code. However, the IDE permits only one iterative design and implementation project per multi-root workspace, and any API specification created from a VS Code window associated with a multi-root workspace automatically belongs to that workspace. To avoid potential issues from limitations on multi-root workspaces, the first step of this procedure starts from a new VS Code window.

To create a new API specification:

. Open a new window in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+n (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+n (Windows).
+
This step prevents the possibility of creating an API specification in a multi-root workspace that already contains iterative design and implementation projects, the first step is start from a new VS Code window.
. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Design an API
----
. Configure your API using the following values:
+
image::design-api-ui-first.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. In *Project name*, type: `*Retrieve Users API*`.
.. In *Project Location*, select *Browse* and then select your home directory.
.. In *API Specification Language*, select *RAML 1.0*.
.. In *Business Group*, select the business group in which you want to create your API specification.
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
You can't change business groups after you create your API specification.
--
. Select *Create Project*.
+
The Explorer displays your *Retrieve Users API* folder with a `retrieve-users-api.raml` file open in the editor.
+
If you receive the error `Unexpected error occurred opening the API Specification`, navigate to your project folder and open the specification file:

.. Press Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
----
.. Navigate to the root directory for the project that contains your API specification. 
.. In the Explorer, click the filename for the specification, `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
// REUSE
. In the editor, add the following RAML specification:
+

              } }]

== Implement the Local API Specification in a Multi-Root Workspace

A local API specification is a project in your Anypoint Code Builder IDE, whether your desktop IDE or the web IDE associated with your user account in Anypoint Platform. Synchronizing your local API specification with a local implementation project in your IDE requires a multi-root workspace in Visual Studio Code.

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement a Local API
----
. Code Builder creates a multi-root workspace to keep your API specification and Mule project in sync.
.. Choose a location to store your workspace. +
Your multi-root workspace is a `.code-workspace` file extension that keeps both of your directories coordinates.
+
[IMPORTANT]
--
Save your `.code-workspace` file in your home directory. Do not save it inside your API specification folder.
--
. After the workspace is created, Code Builder builds your API. 
+
In this step, Code Builder packages the API specification and publishes it to a local Maven repository as a snapshot.
. Wait for the IDE to prompt you for a project name. 
+
[TIP]
--
To monitor the progress of this task:

. Open the output panel by pressing Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+u (Mac)
. From the output panel, select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu.
+
image::select-mule-dx-server.png[]
--
. After building your API, Code Builder can now implement it locally:
.. Choose a project name for your Mule project: `_Retrieve Users Implementation_`.
.. Select your home directory as your target folder.


After Code Builder scaffolds your API specification, it opens a new directory in your newly created multi-root workspace with a Mule project. Note that it creates a flow with the proper APIkit router and another flow for the `GET` resource you designed in the RAML file:

== Update the API Specification

. Navigate back to the `retrieve-users-api.raml` file under the *Retrieve Users API* directory.
+
[TIP]
--
To get a full picture of your API you can arrange the tabs to have the RAML editor, the XML configuration file editor, and the canvas one next to the other.
--
. Add a new `/userbyid` endpoint to your RAML file:

== Re-Scaffold the API Specification

With a new endpoint added to your API specification, you can now re-scaffold it to update your linked Mule project:

. Ensure that the `retrieve-users-api.raml` file is still active in the RAML editor.
. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement this local API
----
. Select the command.
+
Note that Code Builder adds a new flow for the newly added endpoint:

== Save your API Specification in Design Center

With your changes implemented, you can now save your API specification to Design Center:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. Select the plus icon next to `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
. Review the changes in the Source Control view. Note that the file has moved into *Staged Changes*.
. Stage the remaining changes. 
. Enter a message that summarizes the change or changes being made. For example: `_Create Retrieve Users API_`.
// TODO: cc: On Desktop I had to push the "Commit" button here. Is this the same for Web? And then instead of "Push", it was "Sync Changes." Does this also differ from Web?
. Select *Push*.

Your changes are now published in Design Center.


== Publish the API Specification to Exchange

You can now publish your new API specification to Exchange to make it discoverable to other team members.

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
. Type a project name: +
* *Retrieve Users API*.
. Confirm the artifact ID: *Retrieve-Users-API*
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
+
The status bar shows the progress.

After the deployment completes, Code Builder updates your Mule project pom file to point to `v1.0.0` of your API specification.

To work iteratively on a new version of your API specification, close the current workspace and re-import version 1.0.0 of your API from Design Center, and implement it locally again.
