Anypoint Code Builder enables you to scaffold an API specification into the configuration XML for Mule project without first publishing the specification to Anypoint Exchange. For example, if you add a new endpoint to your API specification, Anypoint Code Builder is able to scaffold a new flow for that endpoint through the command `MuleSoft: Implement this local API`.

////
TODO duke: TBD: INTEGRATE THIS INFO? 
Implementing a local API enables you to reflect your changes to your API design directly into the Mule project that implements your API specification.

You can close your multi-root workspace by running the Workspaces: Close Worspace command. You can re-open your synchronized project by opening the workspace your created when you started implementing your local API.
////

== Before You Begin

Set up your MuleSoft environment. See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information. 

== Create an API Specification in a New VS Code Window

[[avoid-issue]]
//anchor for link from first step to this intro
Iterative API design and implementation within the IDE takes place in a multi-root workspace in VS Code. However, the IDE permits only one iterative design and implementation project per multi-root workspace, and any API specification created from a VS Code window associated with a multi-root workspace automatically belongs to that workspace. To avoid potential issues from limitations of multi-root workspaces, the first step of this procedure starts from a new VS Code window.

To create a new API specification:

. Open a new window in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+n (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+n (Windows).
+
This step helps prevent the possibility of creating an API specification in a multi-root workspace that already contains iterative design and implementation projects and ensures that the command required in the next procedure, <<implement-local>>, is available.
. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Design an API
----
. Configure your API using the following values:
+
image::design-api-ui-first.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. In *Project name*, type: `*Retrieve Users API*`.
.. In *Project Location*, select *Browse* and then select your home directory.
.. In *API Specification Language*, select *RAML 1.0*.
.. In *Business Group*, select the business group in which you want to create your API specification. You can't change business groups after you create your API specification.
. Select *Create Project*.
+
The Explorer displays your *Retrieve Users API* folder with a `retrieve-users-api.raml` file open in the editor.
+
If you receive the error `Unexpected error occurred opening the API Specification`, navigate to your project folder and open the specification file:

.. Press Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
----
.. Navigate to the root directory for the project that contains your API specification. 
.. In the Explorer, click the filename for the specification, `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
// REUSE
. In the editor, add the following RAML specification for an example:
+

                "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
              } }]
--
. Proceed to <<implement-local>>.

[[implement-local]]
== Implement the Local API Specification in a Multi-Root Workspace

Synchronizing your local API specification with a local implementation project in your IDE requires a multi-root workspace in Visual Studio Code. A local project for a specification or implementation resides in your Anypoint Code Builder IDE, whether in your desktop IDE or in the web IDE associated with your user account in Anypoint Platform. 

To implement your specification in a multi-root workspace:

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement this Local API
----
+
The UI displays the following message: *We'll create a workspace to keep your API specification and Mule project in sync.*
+
If you do not find the command `MuleSoft: Implement this Local API` in the command palette, go to <<fix-project>>.
. Choose a folder for your workspace, such as the _parent folder_ that contains your API specification project folder. _Do not_ select a folder within your API specification directory.
+
A multi-root workspace uses a `.code-workspace` file extension. 
+
The UI displays the message *Implementing local API Implementation, please wait*. 
. After waiting for the field *Mule project name* to appear in the UI, start the scaffolding process by entering a name for your Mule project in that field. 
+
After scaffolding your API specification, the IDE opens a directory in your new multi-root workspace with a Mule project.
+
[TIP]

To monitor the progress of this task:

.. Open the output panel by pressing Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+u (Mac)
.. From the output panel, select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu.
+
image::select-mule-dx-server.png[]
--
. Open the new Mule project with the scaffolded specification in your multi-root workspace. 
+
* The UI canvas for the project contains a Router component and several error handlers. APIkit automatically creates these components during the scaffolding process.
* The `<flow/>` element contains an `<ee:transform/>` element with your example:
+

== Update the API Specification and Re-scaffold the Implementation XML

Add an endpoint to your specification file and re-scaffold:

. Navigate back to the `retrieve-users-api.raml` file under the *Retrieve Users API* directory.
. Add a new `/userbyid` endpoint to your RAML file:

. To save your specification to the SCM in Design Center, go to <<save-spec>>.

[[save-spec]]
== Save your API Specification in Design Center

After implementing your API specification, save the specification to Design Center:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select the *SOURCE CONTROL* view of the IDE by pressing ^+Shift+g (Mac).
. Locate the API specification project for `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
. Use the *+* icon beside your API specification project files to stage commits. 
. Type a commit message that summarizes the changes. For example: `_Create Retrieve Users API_`
+
This step avoids the need to specify a commit message through a separate file that pops up in the IDE.
. Click *Commit* for the staged changes, and wait for the commit process to complete. 
. If prompted, click *Sync Changes* or *Push*. 
//TODO: OMG, different options every time... :(

Your changes are now published in Design Center.

== Publish the API Specification to Exchange

You can now publish your new API specification to Exchange to make it discoverable to other team members.

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
. Type a project name: +
* *Retrieve Users API*.
. Confirm the artifact ID: *Retrieve-Users-API*
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
+
The status bar shows the progress.

After the deployment completes, Code Builder updates your Mule project pom file to point to `v1.0.0` of your API specification.

To work iteratively on a new version of your API specification, close the current workspace and re-import version 1.0.0 of your API from Design Center, and implement it locally again.
