Anypoint Code Builder enables you to scaffold an API specification into the configuration XML for Mule project without first publishing the specification to Anypoint Exchange. For example, if you add a new endpoint to your API specification, Anypoint Code Builder is able to scaffold a new flow for that endpoint through the command `MuleSoft: Implement this local API`.

////
TODO duke: TBD: INTEGRATE THIS INFO? 
You can close your multi-root workspace by running the Workspaces: Close Workspace command. You can re-open your synchronized project by opening the workspace your created when you started implementing your local API.
////

== Before You Begin

Set up your MuleSoft environment. See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information. 

== Create an API Specification in a New VS Code Window

Iterative API design and implementation within the IDE takes place in a multi-root workspace in VS Code. The IDE permits only one iterative design and implementation project per multi-root workspace. 

To avoid potential issues from limitations of multi-root workspaces, start with a new VS Code window, and create a parent folder for the specification so that you cannot create the specification in a multi-root workspace:

. Open a new window in VS Code by pressing Ctrl+Shift+n (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+n (Windows).
+
This step helps prevent the possibility of creating an API specification in a multi-root workspace that already contains iterative design and implementation projects and ensures that the command required in the next procedure, <<implement-local>>, is available.
. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Design an API
----
. Configure your API using the following values:
+
image::design-api-ui-first.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. In *Project name*, type: `*Retrieve Users API*`.
.. In *Project Location*, select *Browse*, and create a _parent folder_ for your project. For example:
+
`/Users/me/my-iterative-project-folder`
+
To avoid potential issues, do not use an existing project folder for iterative design and implementation projects.
.. In *API Specification Language*, select *RAML 1.0*.
.. In *Business Group*, select the business group in which you want to create your API specification. You can't change business groups after you create your API specification.
. Select *Create Project*.
+
This process creates a child folder that contains your API specification.
. Navigate to your API specification, and open the specification file:

.. Press Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
----
.. Navigate to the root directory of the folder that contains your API specification. 
.. In the Explorer, click the filename for the specification, `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
. In the editor, add this example:
+

                "bs": "harness real-time e-markets"
              } }]
--
. Proceed to <<implement-local>>.

[[implement-local]]
== Implement the Local API Specification in a Multi-Root Workspace

Synchronizing your local API specification with a local implementation project in your IDE requires a multi-root workspace in Visual Studio Code. A local project for a specification or implementation resides in your Anypoint Code Builder IDE, whether in your desktop IDE or in the web IDE associated with your user account in Anypoint Platform. 

To implement your specification in a multi-root workspace:

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement this Local API
----
+
The UI displays the following message: *We'll create a workspace to keep your API specification and Mule project in sync.*
+
_Do not select_ the command `MuleSoft: Implement an API Specification`, which is for implementing a specification that is published on Anypoint Exchange and _not for_ implementing a local API specification.  
+
If you don't find `MuleSoft: Implement this Local API` in the command palette, go to <<display-command>>.
. Choose a folder for your workspace, such as the _parent folder_ that contains your API specification project folder. _Do not_ select a folder within your API specification directory.
+
A multi-root workspace uses a `.code-workspace` file extension. 
. After waiting for up to a minute for the field *Mule project name* to appear in the UI, start the scaffolding process by entering a name for your Mule project. 
+
The UI provides updates while the scaffolding process takes place:

.. *Implementing local API Implementation, please wait*
.. *Scaffolding process ended. You can now start iterating over your local API and implementation project*
. For from your multi-root workspace in the Explorer, open the configuration XML for the new Mule project with the scaffolded specification.
+
* The UI canvas for this Mule project contains a Router component and several error handlers. APIkit automatically creates these components during the scaffolding process.
* The `<flow/>` element contains an `<ee:transform/>` element with your example:
+

[[update-api-spec]]
== Update the API Specification and Re-scaffold the Implementation XML

Add an endpoint to your specification file and re-scaffold:

. Navigate back to the `retrieve-users-api.raml` file under the *Retrieve Users API* directory.
. Add a new `/userbyid` endpoint to your RAML file:

. To save your specification to the SCM in Design Center, go to <<save-spec>>.

[[save-spec]]
== Save your API Specification in Design Center

After implementing your API specification, save the specification to Design Center:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select the *SOURCE CONTROL* view of the IDE:

* In the desktop IDE, navigate to *View* > *Source Control*.
* In the web IDE, navigate to file menu > *View* > *Source Control*.
. Locate the API specification project for `retrieve-users-api.raml`.
. In the *SOURCE CONTROL* view, click the *+* icon beside your API specification project file to stage your changes. 
. Type a commit message that summarizes the changes. For example: `_Create Retrieve Users API_`
+
This step avoids the need to specify a commit message through a separate file that pops up in the IDE.
. Click *Commit* for the staged changes, and wait for the commit process to complete. 
. If prompted, click *Sync Changes* or *Push*. 
//TODO: OMG, different options every time... :(
+
Your changes are now stored in the Design Center SCM.
. Proceed to <<publish>>.

[[publish]]
== Publish the API Specification to Exchange

You can now publish your new API specification to Exchange to make it discoverable to other team members.

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
. Type a project name: *Retrieve Users API*
. Confirm the artifact ID: *Retrieve-Users-API*
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
+
The status bar displays the progress, first *Publishing API Specification to Exchange* and when done, a message that the project *has been successfully published to Exchange*. Then the IDE updates your Mule project POM file to point to `v1.0.0` of your API specification.
+
. To work iteratively on a new version of your API specification, close the current workspace and re-import version 1.0.0 of your API from Design Center, and implement it locally again.

[[display-command]]
== Display MuleSoft: Implement this Local API Command

If `MuleSoft: Implement this Local API Command` does not appear in the command palette from your open API specification project, it is likely that another project in your multi-root workspace is implementing a local API specification. 

To address this issue, remove the API specification from that workspace, and create the specification in another directory.

. In the Explorer, right-click your new API specification folder, select *Remove project from workspace*, and delete the specification project. 
. Create a new directory for your API specification outside of the current workspace.
+
Make sure that this new folder does not have a `.code-workspace` file at its root.
+
. Recreate the API specification in the new folder:
+
When creating the API specification, select your new directory as the *Project Location*. The root directory for your API specification becomes a child of this project location. 
. Navigate to the root directory of API specification:
.. Press Ctrl+Shift+p (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+p (Windows), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder
---- 
.. Find and open the root directory for your new API specification. 
.. Begin the procedure <<implement-local>>.
