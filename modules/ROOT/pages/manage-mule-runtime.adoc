= Mule Runtime Not Found or Not Installed Errors

Anypoint Code Builder bundles an instance of Mule Runtime version 4 to help you during your implement and integration tasks. You must always have a Mule runtime configured to be able to use the features that enable you to develop Mule applications.

Code Builder uses two properties to control the embedded Mule Runtime engine instance:

* *Mule Runtimes Directory*: The default location of the Mule runtime engine installation. +
Default value: `/Users/<user-name>/muleRuntimes/`.
* *Mule Home*: The full path that points to the root files of the Mule Runtime instance. +
Default value: `/Users/<user-name>/muleRuntimes/<mule-runtime-installation>`.

[WARNING]
--
Changing the *Mule Runtimes Directory* and *Mule Home* properties causes unexpected errors.

Modify these values only if you encounter any of the errors detailed in this article.

== Troubleshooting Mule Runtime Errors

If you encounter runtime errors when developing an integration or implementing an API, troubleshoot them as follows:

=== Mule Runtime Is Not Installed, You Must Configure a Mule Runtime to Enable This Feature

This error happens when you attempt to use a feature that requires a working Mule Runtime engine configured. For example, attempting to use auto-complete, or run a debug session. It's possible that one or both of the *Mule Home* and *Mule Runtimes Directory* are misconfigured, or empty. To troubleshoot this:

. Navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view, and select the *Open ACB Settings* icon.

. Locate the *Mule > Runtime: Mule Home* and *Mule > Runtime: Mule Runtimes Directory* properties:

. Provide the full path to the folder that contains Mule runtime. This field must not be empty. 

=== No Mule runtime found. To perform this action, you must have Mule runtime configured.

This warning happens when you open Anypoint Code Builder without a Mule Runtime engine configured. It's possible that one or both of the *Mule Home* and *Mule Runtimes Directory* are misconfigured, or empty. To troubleshoot this:

. Navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view, and select the *Open ACB Settings* icon.
