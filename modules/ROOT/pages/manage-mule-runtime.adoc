= Manage Mule Runtime in Code Builder

Anypoint Code Builder bundles an instance of Mule Runtime engine for the implement and integration tasks. You must always have a Mule runtime configured to be able to use the features that enable you to develop Mule applications.

Code Builder has two properties to manage the embedded Mule Runtime engine instance:

* *Mule Home*: The full path that points to the ZIP file of the Mule Runtime instance. +
Default value: `/Users/<user-name>/muleRuntimes/<mule-runtime-zip-file>`.
* *Mule Runtimes Directory*: The default location in which all Mule runtime engine ZIP files are downloaded. +
Default value: `/Users/<user-name>/muleRuntimes/`.

[WARNING]
--
Changing the *Mule Home* and *Mule Runtimes Directory* properties requires advanced knowledge of Mule runtime.

Changing the default values causes unexpected errors.

== Troubleshooting Embedded Mule Runtime Errors

If you encounter runtime errors when developing an integration or implementing an API, troubleshoot them as follows:


=== Mule Runtime Is Not Installed, You Must Configure a Mule Runtime to Enable This Feature

This error happens when you attempt to use a feature that requires a working Mule Runtime engine configured. for example, attempting to use auto-complete, or run a debug session. It's possible that one or both of the *Mule Home* and *Mule Runtimes Directory* are misconfigured, or empty. To troubleshoot this:

. Navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view, and select the *Open ACB Settings* icon.

. Locate the *Mule > Runtime: Mule Home* and *Mule > Runtime: Mule Runtimes Directory* properties:
+

. Ensure that both fields are not empty, and that the configurations point to an actual ZIP file containing Mule runtime.

=== No Mule runtime found. To perform this action, you must have Mule runtime configured.

This warning happens when you open Anypoint Code Builder without a Mule Runtime engine configured. It's possible that one or both of the *Mule Home* and *Mule Runtimes Directory* are misconfigured, or empty. To troubleshoot this:

. Navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view, and select the *Open ACB Settings* icon.

. Locate the *Mule > Runtime: Mule Home* and *Mule > Runtime: Mule Runtimes Directory* properties:

. Ensure that both fields are not empty, and that the configurations point to an actual ZIP file containing Mule runtime.
