=== Use a Lightweith Package

A lightweight package of a Mule application does not include any dependencies declared in the `pom.xml` file. This JAR file cannot be deployed to a Mule runtime engine, it only offers a way to archive just the Mule applicationâ€™s source files and metadata required to import the JAR package back into Anypoint Studio.
