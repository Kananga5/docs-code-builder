= Ping a Locally Deployed App

Because Anypoint Code Builder works as a web IDE, consider that you must ping a different URL to trigger the execution of locally deployed Mule applications.

When you want to ping an application that it's triggered by an HTTP listener, you must use a different URL than `localhost`

== Ping a Locally Deployed Application Using a Browser

. Open the Mule project that you want to test and navigate to *Run* > *Start Debugging* (`F5`).
. After your application deploys successfully, open a new tab in your browser.
. Type the URL of your web IDE instance, add the `/proxy/` path, and then add the port number you configured as a new path:
`+https://<web-IDE-instance>/api/<port-you-configured-on-your-listener>/+`
+
For example:
+
[source]
--
https://pilar-t21fc0x.builder.code.com/proxy/8081/
--
+
See xref:manage-web-ide-instance.adoc[] to ensure that you are using the correct instance URL.
. When pinging that URL, Anypoint Code Builder triggers the Mule flow.

== Ping a Locally Deployed Application Using a REST Client

. Open Anypoint Code Builder using your browser's Developer Tools (`F12`).
. Navigate to your *Application* tab.
. Under *Storage*, expand the *Cookies* section and select the URL of your web IDE instance.

. Copy both cookies names and values: `_auth_proxy.sig` and `_auth_proxy`. For example:
+
[source]
--
_auth_proxy.sig=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx; _auth_proxy=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx==
--
. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the Mule project that you want to test and navigate to *Run* > *Start Debugging* (`F5`).
. After your application deploys successfully, open your preferred REST client application.
. Type the URL of your web IDE instance in the request URL section, add the `/proxy/` path, and then add the port number you configured as a new path:
`+https://<web-IDE-instance>/api/<port-you-configured-on-your-listener>/+`
+
For example:
+
[source]
--
https://pilar-t21fc0x.builder.code.com/proxy/8081/
--
+
See xref:manage-web-ide-instance.adoc[] to ensure that you are using the correct instance URL.
. Configure the headers to send the necessary cookies that you copied earlier:

. When pinging that URL, Anypoint Code Builder triggers the Mule flow.
