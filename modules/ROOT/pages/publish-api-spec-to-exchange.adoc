= Publish an API Specification to Exchange

You can publish your API specification to Exchange to make it discoverable to other team members.

When publishing an API to Exchange, you create a new API asset with that API, and you can later use it to implement it into a Mule application.


== Before You Begin

* Ensure you set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* You created a basic structure for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* You configured request and response data for  your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* Your local changes are in sync with Anypoint Design Center. +
See xref:syncrhonize-with-design-center.adoc[].
