= Publishing an API Specification to Exchange

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

Publish your API specification to Exchange to make it discoverable to other team members.

When publishing an API to Exchange, you create a new API asset with that API, and you can later use it to implement it into a Mule application.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Created a basic structure for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* Configured request and response data for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* Synced your local changes with Anypoint Design Center. +
See xref:synchronize-with-design-center.adoc[].

== Publish an API to Exchange

To publish your API to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your `american-flights-api.raml` file.
. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]

//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.

. Type a project name: +
* *American Flights API ACB*.
+

. Confirm the artifact ID: *American-Flights-API-ACB*
+

. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
+
image::set-asset-version.png["American Flights API ACB version highlighted"]
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.

. Select *No* when prompted to implement the API.
+
[NOTE]
--
Selecting *Yes* when prompted to implement the API enables you to directly scaffold your API specification into an implementation to code the logic behind each endpoint.

// TODO: I would rewrite the above sentences to explain what happens in each case.

== Locate Your API in Exchange

After publishing your API specification, you can find it in Anypoint Exchange:

. Navigate to Anypoint Platform and login using your credentials.
. Navigate to Anypoint Exchange.
. Notice that your API specification is listed as an asset. +
You can select the API, navigate through its summary, and see all the endpoints you defined in the previous tasks.
