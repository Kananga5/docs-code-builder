= Publish an API Specification to Exchange

Publish your API specification to Exchange to make it discoverable to other team members.

When publishing an API to Exchange, you create a new API asset with that API, and you can later use it to implement it into a Mule application.


== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Created a basic structure for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* Configured request and response data for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* Synced your local changes with Anypoint Design Center. +
See xref:synchronize-with-design-center.adoc[].

== Publishing an API to Exchange

To publish your API to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your `american-flights-api.raml` file.
. Open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange_.
+

. Type a project name: +
* *American Flights API ACB*.
+
image::set-asset-name.png[]
. Confirm the artifact ID: *American-Flights-API-ACB*
+
image::set-artifact-ID.png[]
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
+
image::set-asset-version.png[]
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
+

+
The status bar shows the progress.

. Select *No* when prompted to implement the API.
+
[NOTE]
--
Selecting *Yes* when prompted to implement the API enables you to directly scaffold your API specification into an implementation to code the logic behind each endpoint.

== Locate Your API in Exchange

After publishing your API specification, you can find it in Anypoint Exchange:

. Navigate to Anypoint Platform and login using your credentials.
. Navigate to Anypoint Exchange.
. Notice that your API specification is listed as an asset. +
You can select the API, navigate through its summary, and see all the endpoints you defined in the previous tasks.
