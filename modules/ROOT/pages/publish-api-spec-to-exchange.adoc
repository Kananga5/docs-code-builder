Publish your API specification to Exchange to make it discoverable by other team members.

When publishing an API to Exchange, create an API asset with your API to implement later in a Mule application.

== Before You Begin

If you haven't started the American Flight API example, follow the procedures in this order:
+
. xref:test-api-specification.adoc[]
. add-request-response-details.adoc[]
. test-api-specification.adoc[]
. synchronize-with-design-center.adoc[]


== Publish an API to Exchange

To publish your API to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your `american-flights-api.raml` file.
. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]

//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.

. Type a project name: +
* *American Flights API ACB*.
+
image::set-asset-name.png["American Flights API ACB option highlighted"]
. Confirm the artifact ID: *American-Flights-API-ACB*
+
image::set-artifact-ID.png["American Flights API ACB artifact highlighted"]
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
+
image::set-asset-version.png["American Flights API ACB version highlighted"]
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
+
image::set-api-version.png["API version highlighted"]
+
The status bar shows the progress.

. Select *No* when prompted to implement the API.
+
[NOTE]
--
Selecting *Yes* when prompted to implement the API enables you to directly scaffold your API specification into an implementation to code the logic behind each endpoint.

// TODO: I would rewrite the above sentences to explain what happens in each case.

== Locate Your API in Exchange

After publishing your API specification, you can find it in Anypoint Exchange:

. Navigate to Anypoint Platform and login using your credentials.
. Navigate to Anypoint Exchange.
. Notice that your API specification is listed as an asset. +
You can select the API, navigate through its summary, and see all the endpoints you defined in the previous tasks.
