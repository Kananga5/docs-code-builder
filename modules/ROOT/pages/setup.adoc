Anypoint Code Builder is built from the Anypoint Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code. Both the desktop and web IDEs for Anypoint Code Builder share these extensions. The web IDE provides built-in extensions to the code-server implementation of Visual Studio Code for the web.

* <<set-up-desktop>>: For the desktop IDE, you must load the extension pack to your local Visual Studio Code IDE. 
* <<set-up-web>>: For the web IDE, you must log in to Anypoint Platform and acquire the permission to use Anypoint Code Builder.

== Desktop IDE Setup

The desktop-based IDE extensions in Anypoint Extension Pack are available from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

Before you begin: +
Install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git^], and add git to your `PATH`. To work properly, an Anypoint Extension Pack extension (Anypoint Code Builder - API Extension) depends on this requirement. 

For information about OS and system compatibility, see xref:acb-release-notes.adoc[].

. Open VS Code. 
. Find *Anypoint Extension Pack* from the desktop IDE or from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.mule-dx-extension-pack[Visual Studio Marketplace^].
+
[NOTE] 
.To avoid installation errors:
==== 
* For the Beta release, install the _pre-release_ version of the extension pack.
+
Attempting to install the _release_ version produces the error `Can't install release version of 'salesforce.mule-dx-extension-pack' extension because it has no release version.`  

* Do not install the individual Anypoint Code Builder extensions that are also available separately from the marketplace.
====

* To install from the desktop IDE, launch the Extensions menu by clicking the Extensions icon from the activity menu or pressing Cmd+Shift+x (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+x (Windows), and search for the extension pack.

[WARNING]
--
During the open beta, your web IDE instance might get deleted, causing you to lose your integrations, automations, and APIs.

To save your work, you must either deploy your Mule projects to CloudHub, commit them to source control, or publish your API specifications to Design Center.

If you are using an Anypoint Platform trial account that loses access to Anypoint Code Builder after your trial expires, the web IDE instances are deleted.

Do not use Anypoint Code Builder to develop APIs, integrations, or automations for production environments.
