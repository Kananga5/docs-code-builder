Anypoint Code Builder is built from the Anypoint Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code. Both the desktop and cloud IDEs for Anypoint Code Builder share these extensions. The cloud IDE provides built-in extensions to the code-server implementation of Visual Studio Code for the web.

//TODO: ADD GRAPHIC TO SHOW MULESOFT ICON IN THE ACTIVITY BAR AND THE MAIN PAGE

* <<set-up-desktop>>: For the desktop IDE, you must load the extension pack to your local Visual Studio Code IDE. 
* <<set-up-web>>: For the cloud IDE, you must log in to Anypoint Platform and acquire the permission to use Anypoint Code Builder. 

[[set-up-desktop]]
== Desktop IDE Setup

The desktop-based IDE extensions in Anypoint Extension Pack are available from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

Before you begin: +
Install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git^], and add git to your `PATH`. To work properly, an Anypoint Extension Pack extension (Anypoint Code Builder - API Extension) depends on this requirement. 

For information about OS and system compatibility, see xref:acb-release-notes.adoc[].

. Open VS Code. 
. Find *Anypoint Extension Pack* from the desktop IDE or from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=salesforce.mule-dx-extension-pack[Visual Studio Marketplace^].
+
[NOTE] 
.To avoid installation errors:
==== 
* For the Beta release, install the _pre-release_ version of the extension pack.
+
Attempting to install the _release_ version produces the error `Can't install release version of 'salesforce.mule-dx-extension-pack' extension because it has no release version.`  

* Do not install the individual Anypoint Code Builder extensions that are also available separately from the marketplace.
====

* To install from the desktop IDE, launch the Extensions menu by clicking the Extensions icon from the activity menu or pressing Cmd+Shift+x (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+x (Windows), and search for the extension pack.
+
image::acb-setup-desktop-extensions-ide.png["Installing Anypoint Extension Pack from VS Code Marketplace"]
+
Select *Install Pre-Release Version*.

* To install from the Visual Studio Marketplace website, find the extension pack, and install:
+
image::acb-setup-desktop-extensions.png["Installing Anypoint Extension Pack from VS Code Marketplace"]
+
Select *Install Pre-Release Version*.
+
For additional guidance, see the https://code.visualstudio.com/learn/get-started/extensions[Visual Studio Code website^].
. Open the Extensions menu, and review the extensions in Anypoint Extension Pack:
+
image::acb-setup-extensions-list.png[]
+
Anypoint Extension Pack contains these extensions:

* Anypoint Code Builder - API Extension
* Anypoint Code Builder - APIKit Extension
* Anypoint Code Builder - DataWeave Extension
* Anypoint Code Builder - Dependencies Extension
* Anypoint Code Builder - Integration Extension
* Anypoint Code Builder - Mule Runtime Extension
* Anypoint Code Builder - Platform Extension

. Click the MuleSoft icon in the activity bar to access and use Anypoint Code Builder features.
+
[[acb-menu]]
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png["MuleSoft icon for Anypoint Code Builder in the activity bar"]

. Check that the IDE loads the <<acb-menu, Anypoint Code Builder menu>> with *Quick Actions* and *Documentation* links.

== Cloud IDE Access

Anypoint Code Builder is available on separate US and EU cloud hosts for Anypoint Platform. To help your organization meet emerging regulatory requirements that differ by region, Anypoint Platform does not share organization information, permissions, account data, or API and Mule projects between US and EU hosts. 

* US Cloud: 
+
MuleSoft hosts this control plane within data centers in the United States.
* EU Cloud: 
+
MuleSoft hosts this control plane within EU (Dublin) data centers. 

If you have an account in one cloud but need to work in another, you must create an account in that cloud to create and work on your projects. In addition to hosting your cloud-specific projects, Anypoint Platform also hosts deployment targets for managed runtimes and related data, including data and metadata about your Mule implementations.

Your cloud IDE environment is associated with your user account, which other users cannot access. The environment has a unique URL that only you can access. To share a project that you are working on with your team, do not attempt to share the URL with others. Instead, xref:package-mule-application.adoc[export] a Mule project to a sharable JAR file, xref:des-publish-api-spec-to-exchange.adoc#publish-an-api-to-exchange[publish] your API specification project or fragment to Anypoint Exchange, or store shared work in a git repository. 
//TODO: LINK TO INFO ON GIT SETUP - COMING SOON

See xref:hosting-home::index.adoc[] for more information.

=== Before You Begin

* Anypoint Platform requires a user account. You can use an existing account or create one. Trial accounts are allowed. 

* An administrator with an Anypoint Platform organization account must provide you with access to Anypoint Code Builder. See xref:configure-permissions.adoc[Configure Permissions]. 
+
Organization Administrators for Anypoint Platform are allowed to add the permission to your user account or to the team to which your user account belongs. 

//TODO: REQUIRES EDITS AND POSSIBLE REVAMP
== Launch the Cloud IDE 

. Log in to Anypoint Platform:
+
You must use the URI for the host that contains your user account, which is associated with a specific business organization and Anypoint Platform host. The accounts and business organizations are not shared across the hosts. 
+
Anypoint Platform is hosted on EU-compliant and U.S. instances: 

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/[anypoint.mulesoft.com^] for the U.S. host (supports all non-EU regions)
* https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/login[eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com^] for the EU-compliant host 

. Accept any terms and conditions for use of Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Launch Cloud IDE*.
+
After provisioning of your cloud IDE is complete, the IDE opens. The provisioning process can take a few minutes.
. Click the MuleSoft icon in the activity bar to see and use Anypoint Code Builder features.
//TODO: ADD SCREENSHOT HERE OR SOMEWHERE ELSE THAT MAKES SENSE

[WARNING]
--
During the open beta, your cloud IDE instance might get deleted, causing you to lose your integrations, automations, and APIs.

To save your work, you must either deploy your Mule projects to CloudHub, commit them to source control, or publish your API specifications to Design Center.

If you are using an Anypoint Platform trial account that loses access to Anypoint Code Builder after your trial expires, the cloud IDE instances are deleted.

Do not use Anypoint Code Builder to develop APIs, integrations, or automations for production environments.
