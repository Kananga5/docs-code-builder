Anypoint Code Builder is built from the Anypoint Extension Pack for Visual Studio Code. Both the desktop and cloud IDEs for Anypoint Code Builder share these extensions. The cloud IDE provides built-in extensions to the code-server implementation of Visual Studio Code for the web.

//TODO: ADD GRAPHIC TO SHOW MULESOFT ICON IN THE ACTIVITY BAR AND THE MAIN PAGE

* <<set-up-desktop>>: For the desktop IDE, you must load the extension pack to your local Visual Studio Code IDE. 
* <<set-up-web>>: For the cloud IDE, you must log in to Anypoint Platform and acquire the permission to use Anypoint Code Builder. 

[[set-up-desktop]]
== Desktop IDE Setup

The desktop-based IDE extensions in Anypoint Extension Pack are available from the Visual Studio Marketplace.

Before you begin: 

Install https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git[git^], and add git to your `PATH`. To work properly, an Anypoint Extension Pack extension (Anypoint Code Builder - API Extension) depends on this requirement. 

* <<install-pack>>
* <<update-pack>>

For information about OS and system compatibility, see xref:acb-release-notes.adoc[].

+
Select *Install Release Version*.

* To install from the Visual Studio Marketplace website, find the extension pack, and install:
+
Select *Install Release Version*.

[[update-pack]]
=== Update Anypoint Service Pack 

If Anypoint Service Pack is installed on your desktop IDE, update to the latest version of the service pack by following VS Code instructions in https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/extension-marketplace#_update-an-extension-manually[Update an extension manually^].

[[set-up-web]]
== Launch the Cloud IDE 

Launch your cloud IDE from Anypoint Platform. Your Anypoint Platform user account and business organization are hosted in the US or EU cloud and are not shared across the hosts.

Before You Begin:

* Anypoint Platform requires a user account. You can use an existing account or create one. Trial accounts are allowed. 

* An administrator with an Anypoint Platform organization account must provide you with access to Anypoint Code Builder. See xref:configure-permissions.adoc[Configure Permissions]. 

* Review important open beta information:
+
[WARNING]
--
During the open beta, your cloud IDE instance might get deleted, causing you to lose your integrations, automations, and APIs.

.Click for more information:
[%collapsible]
====
To save your work, you must either deploy your Mule projects to CloudHub, commit them to source control, or publish your API specifications to Design Center.

If you are using an Anypoint Platform trial account that loses access to Anypoint Code Builder after your trial expires, the cloud IDE instances are deleted.

Do not use the beta version of Anypoint Code Builder to develop APIs, integrations, or automations for production environments.
====
--

To launch your cloud IDE from Anypoint Platform:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform:

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/[anypoint.mulesoft.com^] for the U.S. host (supports all non-EU regions)
* https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/login[eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com^] for the EU-compliant host 
+
If you have an account in one cloud but need to work in another, you must create an account in that cloud to create and work on your projects. 

. Accept any terms and conditions for use of Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Launch Cloud IDE*.
+
image::acb-launch-cloud-ide.png["Launch button for the cloud IDE in Anypoint Platform"]
+
After provisioning of your cloud IDE is complete, the IDE opens. The provisioning process can take a few minutes.
+
Your cloud IDE environment is associated with your user account, which other users cannot access. The cloud environment has a unique URL that only you can access and that is _not_ embedded within the Anypoint Platform UI. You can reopen your cloud IDE directly from that URL or relaunch it indirectly from Anypoint Code Builder in Anypoint Platform.
. Click the MuleSoft icon in the activity bar to see and use Anypoint Code Builder features.

== Log in to Anypoint Platform from the IDE

Some Anypoint Code Builder features require you to log in directly from the IDE to Anypoint Platform. The IDE prompts you when login is necessary and guides you through the login process. However, it is a good practice to log in from the IDE after opening MuleSoft features in the IDE. 

The status bar in the IDE shows your login status:

* *Not logged in to Anypoint Platform* indicates that you must log in to perform tasks that require a connection to Anypoint Platform. 
+
image::acb-not-logged-in.png[]
+ 
You can log in by clicking this notification and follow the prompts to log in or follow the 
* A link to your user name indicates that you are logged in.
+
You can log out by clicking your user name and following the prmpts.

You can also use the command palette to log in to Anypoint Platform. 

To log in from the IDE from the command palette:

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Login to Anypoint Platform
----
+
image::login-to-anypoint-platform.png[]
+
[TIP]
--
You can type _login_ and use the filter in the results to select the command you want.
--
. Select *Allow* when prompted to sign in to the platform.
+
image::allow-login-to-anypoint-platform.png[]
+
After logging you in, Anypoint Platform displays a *You can close this page now* message.
+
. To verify your login, ensure that *<your-username>* replaces *Not logged in to Anypoint Platform*. 

== Set the Desktop IDE to EU or US Cloud

In the desktop IDE, you can change your Anypoint Platform control plane to the US or EU Cloud. Anypoint Platform instances do not share user accounts, projects, or other data. For more information, see xref:start-acb.adoc#cloud-hosts[US and UE Cloud Hosts]. 

. If an API specification is open in the Explorer panel, close the project to avoid a synchronization error when you switch clouds. 
+
* Desktop IDE: Select *File* > *Close Folder* 
* Cloud IDE: Select the menu icon > *File* > *Close Folder* (cloud IDE).

. Open the Settings tab:

* From the Anypoint Code Builder panel, click the *Open ACB Settings* (gear) icon.
* From the activity bar, click the *Manage* (gear) icon, select *Settings*, and Search for `Mule.` in the *Settings* tab.

. Scroll to *Mule: Control Plane*.
. Select the US or EU Cloud.
