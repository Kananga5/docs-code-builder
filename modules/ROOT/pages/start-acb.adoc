[[set-up-web]]
== Launch the Cloud IDE 

Launch the cloud IDE from Anypoint Platform. Your Anypoint Platform user account and business organization are hosted in the US or EU cloud and are not shared across the hosts.

=== Before You Begin 

Meet prerequisites before attempting to launch the cloud IDE: 

* Anypoint Platform requires a user account. You can use an existing account or create one. Unexpired trial accounts are allowed. 

* An administrator with an Anypoint Platform organization account must provide you with access to Anypoint Code Builder. See xref:configure-permissions.adoc[Configure Permissions]. 

* Review important open beta information:
+
[WARNING]
--
The cloud IDE remains in an open beta period. 

During the open beta, your cloud IDE instance might get deleted, causing you to lose your integrations, automations, and APIs.

.Click for more information:
[%collapsible]
====
To save your work, you must either deploy your Mule projects to CloudHub, commit them to source control, or publish your API specifications to Design Center.

If you are using an Anypoint Platform trial account that loses access to Anypoint Code Builder after your trial expires, the cloud IDE instances are deleted.

Do not use the beta version of Anypoint Code Builder to develop APIs, integrations, or automations for production environments.
====
--

[[login-cloud]]
=== Open the Cloud IDE from Anypoint Platform

To launch the cloud IDE:

. Log in to Anypoint Platform:

* https://anypoint.mulesoft.com/login/[anypoint.mulesoft.com^] for the U.S. host (supports all non-EU regions)
* https://eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com/login[eu1.anypoint.mulesoft.com^] for the EU-compliant host 
+
If you have an account in one cloud but need to work in another, you must create an account in that cloud to create and work on your projects. 

. Accept any terms and conditions for use of Anypoint Platform.
. Click *Launch Cloud IDE*.
+
image::acb-launch-cloud-ide.png["Launch button for the cloud IDE in Anypoint Platform"]
+
After provisioning of your cloud IDE is complete, the IDE opens. The provisioning process can take a few minutes.
+
Your cloud IDE environment is associated with your user account. The cloud environment also has a unique URL that only you can access and that is _not_ embedded within the Anypoint Platform UI. You can reopen your cloud IDE directly from that URL or relaunch it indirectly from Anypoint Code Builder in Anypoint Platform.
. Click the MuleSoft icon in the activity bar to see and use Anypoint Code Builder features.

[[login-ide]]
== Log in to Anypoint Platform from the IDE

Some Anypoint Code Builder features require you to log in directly from the IDE to Anypoint Platform. The IDE prompts you when login is necessary and guides you through the login process. However, it is a good practice to log in from the IDE after opening MuleSoft features in the IDE. 

* Anypoint Platform requires a user account. You can use an existing account or create one from Anypoint Platform in the US or EU Cloud (see xref:anypoint-code-builder/index.adoc#us-eu-clouds[US and EU Cloud Hosts]. Unexpired trial accounts are allowed.

* An administrator with an Anypoint Platform organization account must provide you with access to Anypoint Code Builder. See xref:start-configure-permissions.adoc[].

From the IDE,you can log in from the status bar or through a command:

* <<login-status-bar>>
* <<login-command>>

[[login-status-bar]]
=== Log in from the IDE through the Status Bar

The status bar in the desktop and cloud IDEs shows your login status:

* *Not logged in to Anypoint Platform* indicates that you must log in to perform tasks that require a connection to Anypoint Platform. 
+
image::acb-not-logged-in.png["Login status message in the status bar"]
+ 
You can log in by clicking this notification and following the prompts to log in.
* A link to your user name indicates that you are logged in.
+
You can log out by clicking your user name and following the prompts.

[[login-command]]
=== Log in from the IDE through the Command Palette

You can use the Command Palette to log in to Anypoint Platform. 

To log in from the IDE from the Command Palette:

// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Select the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Login to Anypoint Platform
----
+
image::login-to-anypoint-platform.png[]
+
[TIP]
--
You can type _login_ and use the filter in the results to select the command you want.
--
. Select *Allow* when prompted to sign in to the platform.
+
image::allow-login-to-anypoint-platform.png[]
+
After logging you in, Anypoint Platform displays a *You can close this page now* message.
+
. To verify your login, ensure that *<your-username>* replaces *Not logged in to Anypoint Platform*. 

[[change-clouds]]
== Set the Desktop IDE to the EU or US Cloud

In the desktop IDE, you can change your Anypoint Platform control plane to the US or EU Cloud. US Cloud is the default. Anypoint Platform instances do not share user accounts, projects, or other data. For more information, see xref:index.adoc#us-eu-clouds[US and UE Cloud Hosts]. 

. If an API specification is open in the Explorer view of the IDE, close the project to avoid a synchronization error when you switch clouds. 

* Desktop IDE: Select *File* > *Close Folder* 
* Cloud IDE: Select the image:icon-menu.png["cloud IDE menu",18,18] (menu) icon > *File* > *Close Folder*

. Open the Settings tab from the activity bar in the desktop IDE:
+
image::acb-activity-bar-select-cloud.png["Selecting the EU Cloud from the Desktop IDE"]

* From the Anypoint Code Builder panel, click the *Open ACB Settings* (gear) icon.
* From the activity bar, click the *Manage* (gear) icon, select *Settings*, and search for `mule` in the *Settings* tab.
. Scroll to *Mule: Control Plane*.
. Select the US or EU Cloud.
. If you set the EU Cloud control plane, set an environment variable for your operating system:

* <<add-env-variable-windows>>
* <<add-env-variable-mac>>
. {restart-ide}
. Follow the steps in <<login-ide>>.

[[add-env-variable-windows]]
=== Add the Environment Variable on Windows

If you use the desktop IDE on Windows and your IDE uses Anypoint Platform features in the EU Cloud, ensure that you have access to all of the Anypoint Code Builder features by adding a system environment variable:

. Open *Settings* and:
.. Type `env` in the search box.
.. Select the *Edit the system environment variables* option.
.. Click *Yes*.
. In *System Properties*, select the *Advanced* tab and click *Environment Variable*.
. In the *Environment Variables* window, click *New*.
.. For *Variable Name*, type `ANYPOINT_ENV.`
.. For *Variable Value*, type `prod-eu`.
. Click *OK*.
. Check the environment variable in the Environment Variables window.
+
Alternatively, run this command from the Windows terminal:
+
----
> echo %ANYPOINT_ENV% 
----
+
The terminal returns `prod-eu`. 
. {restart-ide}
. Follow the steps in <<login-ide>>.

[[add-env-variable-mac]]
=== Add the Environment Variable on Mac 

If you use the desktop IDE on Mac and your IDE uses Anypoint Platform features in the EU Cloud, ensure that you have access to all of the Anypoint Code Builder features by adding a system environment variable:

. Open a Terminal window, and enter `vi ~/.zshrc` if you are using zsh shell or `vi ~/.bash_profile` if you are using bash.
. Press `i` to enter insert mode.
. Add the environment variable `export ANYPOINT_ENV=prod-eu` and press Escape to exit insert mode.
. Type `:wq` and press Enter to save and exit the file.
. Type `source ~/.zshrc` if you are using zsh or `source ~/.bash_profile` if you are using bash, to apply the changes.
. {restart-ide}
. Follow the steps in <<login-ide>>.
