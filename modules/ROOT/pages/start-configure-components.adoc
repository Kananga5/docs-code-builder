= Configuring Components

Components represent functional building blocks that perform specific tasks within an integration flow, such as connecting to endpoints, transforming data, or routing messages.

Each component can be selected, dragged onto the canvas, and then configured through a user-friendly interface. Configuration involves specifying properties, defining input/output settings, and establishing connections to external systems or services.

In addition to visual configuration, you can use XML-based configuration files to define and fine-tune the behavior of components.
