= Configuring Components

Components represent functional building blocks that perform specific tasks within an integration flow, such as connecting to endpoints, transforming data, or routing messages. Each component can be configured through a visual interface. Configuration involves specifying properties, defining input/output settings, and establishing connections to external systems or services.

In addition to visual configuration, you can use XML-based configuration files to define and fine-tune the behavior of components.

== Overview of the Component Configuration UI

The configuration UI enables you to edit the properties of a component that is currently selected in your canvas. For example, adding and selecting the *Logger* component invokes the following configuration UI:

// TODO: this is a placeholder image until we figure out which component we want to show
image::configure-logger-properties.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Logger component propertes"]

[calloutlist]
.. Tabs for accessing component properties:
+
* *General* - Basic configuration fields for the component.
* *Input/Output* - Metadata entering (*Input*) and exiting (*Output*) the component.
* *Notes* - Custom component information added for future reference.
.. Editable text field that represents the value of the property.
.. Button that toggles syntax for defining expressions with the DataWeave language.
.. Button that toggles syntax for specifying externally defined configuration properties.

[NOTE]
====
Certain component fields can only be configurable via the XML editor.
====

[NOTE]
====
The configuration UI doesn't support configuring components outside of Flow and Subflow components, such as connections and other global configurations.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure that you:

* xref:start-acb.adoc[Set up and access the web or desktop IDE].
* xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[Create an integration project].

== Add a String to the Logger Component

The Logger component enables you log debug information at various stages of the integration flow. To configure a message that the component prints when the component executes, you can use the configuration UI, selecting the Logger within the flow and customizing its settings.

To open the component configuration UI and set a string as a Logger message:

. On the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon where you want to add the component.
+
image::main-tutorial-add-first-http-listener.png["Mule application canvas"]

. Select *Flow* from the canvas to create an empty flow.
. Add a component to your project from the canvas, for example, add the Logger component.
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the Add Component panel, search for and select Logger.
+
The Logger component configuration UI displays with the following fields:
* *Message* - Optional property that describes the message to log.
* *Level* - Optional property that describes the log level.
* *Category* - Optional property that describes the logger in a way that helps you distinguish it from other loggers in your flow.

. Add a string in the *Message* field, for example:
+
[source,text]
--
get:\flights:american-flights-api-config
--
+
image::configure-logger-message-property.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Logger message component property field populated"]
+
The following snippet is added in the XML editor:
+
[source,xml]
--
<logger doc:name="Logger" message="get:\flights:american-flights-api-config"/>
--

== Add a DataWeave Expression to the Logger Component

To open the component configuration UI and set a DataWeave expression as a Logger message:

. On the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon where you want to add the component.
+
image::main-tutorial-add-first-http-listener.png["Mule application canvas"]

. Select *Flow* from the canvas to create an empty flow.
. Add a component to your project from the canvas, for example, add the Logger component.
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the Add Component panel, search for and select Logger.
+
The Logger component configuration UI displays with the following fields:
* *Message* - Optional property that describes the message to log.
* *Level* - Optional property that describes the log level.
* *Category* - Optional property that describes the logger in a way that helps you distinguish it from other loggers in your flow.

. Add a DataWeave expression in the *Message* field, for example:
+
[source,text]
--
payload.id ++ " is the ID of this payload."
--
. Click the DataWeave expression button for the *Message* field.
// TODO: screenshot of the DataWeave expression in the Message field
+
This example uses DataWeave to concatenate a field in the message payload to the a string. Notice the `#[]` indicates that the message contains an expression or variable.
+
The following snippet is added in the XML editor:
+
[source,xml]
--
<logger
  doc:name="Logger"
  message="#[payload.id ++ " is the ID of this payload."]"/>
--
