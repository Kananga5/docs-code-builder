= Configuring Components

Components represent functional building blocks that perform specific tasks within an integration flow, such as connecting to endpoints, transforming data, or routing messages. Each component can be configured through a visual interface. Configuration involves specifying properties, defining input/output settings, and establishing connections to external systems or services.

In addition to visual configuration, you can use XML-based configuration files to define and fine-tune the behavior of components.

== Overview of the Component Configuration UI

The configuration UI enables you to edit the properties of a component that is currently selected in your canvas. For example, adding and selecting the *Mule -Logger* component invokes the following configuration UI:

// TODO: this is a placeholder image until we figure out which component we want to show
image::configure-logger-properties.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Logger component propertes"]

[calloutlist]
.. Tabs for accessing component properties:
+
* *General* - Basic configuration fields for the component
* *Input/Output* - Metadata entering (*Input*) and exiting (*Output*) the component
* *Notes* - Custom component information added for future reference
.. Editable text field that represents the value of the property
.. Button that toggles syntax for defining expressions with the DataWeave language
.. Button that toggles syntax for specifying externally defined configuration properties

[NOTE]
====
Certain component fields can only be configurable via the XML editor.
====

[NOTE]
====
The configuration UI doesn't support configuring components outside of Flow and Subflow components, such as connections and other global configurations.

Before getting started, ensure that you:

* xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[Create an integration project].

== Add a Message String to the Logger Component

The Logger component enables you log debug information at various stages of the integration flow. To configure a message that the component prints when the component executes, you can use the configuration UI, selecting the Logger within the flow and customizing its settings.

To open the component configuration UI and set a string as a Logger message:

. In the Explorer view, select the XML file for your project, such as `my-project-name.xml`.
+
image::int-empty-canvas.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Mule flow and the Mule configuration file"]
+
[calloutlist]
.. The canvas provides space for a visual representation of your Mule flows or subflows.
.. The configuration XML editor displays the configuration file for your Mule application.
. Select *Flow* from the canvas to create an empty flow.
. Add a component to your project from the canvas, for example, add the Logger component.
.. In the canvas, click the image:icon-plus.png["",15,15] (*Add component*) icon.
.. In the Add Component panel, search for and select Logger.
// TODO: screenshot showing the Logger component in the search results list
+
The Logger component configuration UI displays with the following fields:
// TODO: screenshot of empty Logger component UI
. Add the following string in the *Message* field:
+
[source,text]
--
get:\flights:american-flights-api-config
--
// TODO: screenshot of Logger component UI with message field populated
+
The following snippet is added in the XML editor:
+
[source,xml]
--
<logger doc:name="Logger" message="get:\flights:american-flights-api-config"/>
--
