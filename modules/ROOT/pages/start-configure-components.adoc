= Configuring Components

Components represent functional building blocks that perform specific tasks within an integration flow, such as connecting to endpoints, transforming data, or routing messages. Each component can be configured through a visual interface. Configuration involves specifying properties, defining input/output settings, and establishing connections to external systems or services.

In addition to visual configuration, you can use XML-based configuration files to define and fine-tune the behavior of components.

== Overview of the Component Configuration UI

The configuration UI enables you to edit the properties of a component that is currently selected in your canvas. For example, adding and selecting the *Mule -Logger* component invokes the following configuration UI:

// TODO: this is a placeholder image until we figure out which component we want to show
image::configure-logger-properties.png["Canvas showing visual representation of Logger component propertes"]

. Three tabs:
+
* *General* - Basic configuration fields for the component
* *Input/Output* - Metadata entering (*Input*) and exiting (*Output*) the component
* *Notes* - Custom information added for future reference

. Editable text field that represents the value of the property
. Button that toggles syntax for defining expressions with the DataWeave language
. Button that toggles syntax for specifying externally defined configuration properties
