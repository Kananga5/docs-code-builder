= Controlling Source Files
:page-deployment-options: cloud-ide, desktop-ide

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

Use source control management (SCM) to store and share your design, integration, and implementation projects. A useful SCM provides change history of each file and a branching methodology to maintain project quality, full traceability, the ability to restore earlier versions of your files, and a way to recover source code if your Anypoint Code Builder environment is lost or removed. 

GitHub and the Git command line interface (CLI) are widely used in the industry and supported  by VS Code out-of-the-box, with minimal configuration. The procedures on this page show how to set up and use GitHub for source control. VS Code extensions for other SCM systems are also available for you to set up and use. For information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview#_scm-providers[SCM Providers^]. 

For more information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/overview[Using Git source control in VS Code^] in the VS Code documentation.  For detailed information about Git, see the https://git-scm.com/book[Git documentation^].

=== Anypoint SCM for API Design Projects

include::partial$acb-api-design.adoc[tags="api-dc-scm-scope"]

The process for using the Anypoint SCM to store and sync design project changes in Anypoint Code Builder with the project in Design Center is identical to synchronizing other changes (see <<commit-source>>). If you prefer to use your own remote repository on GitHub to store your API project, without synchronizing with the project in Design Center, see <<add-remote>>. VS Code supports multiple remote configurations.

As of the February 2024 release, design projects that you create from Anypoint Code Builder with *Design an API* (see xref:des-create-api-specs.adoc#design-new-api-spec[Create a New API Specification Project]) or with the command `MuleSoft: Design an API` no longer spawn a corresponding design project in Design Center or use the Anypoint SCM to store changes and keep the two projects in sync. Configuring an SCM for these design projects is the same as for integration and implementation projects. For guidance, see <<create-repo>> or <<add-remote>>.

[[prereqs]]
== Before You Begin

Ensure that these prerequisites are in place:

* A GitHub account
+
If you do not have an account create one from the https://github.com/join[Join GitHub^] page on the GitHub site.

* A Git installation on your computer 
+
If Git is not installed on your computer, follow the https://github.com/git-guides/install-git[Git installation instructions^] for your machine.

* Access to Anypoint Code Builder from the desktop or cloud IDE
+
For setup and installation information, see xref:start-acb.adoc[], and be sure to meet all prerequisites. 

* A project in Anypoint Code Builder
+
For example, to create an integration project, see xref:int-create-integrations.adoc[].

* A GitHub user name and email configuration. See <<config-git>>.

[[config-git]]
== Configure Your GitHub Properties

Check for and configure your username and email properties so that you can add, update, and retrieve your project files from a remote repository in GitHub. 

. Meet the prerequisites in <<prereqs>>.
//open ACB terminal:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
. From the Anypoint Code Builder terminal, check for any existing GitHub configuration by running this command:
+
[source,command]
----
git config --list
----

* If your GitHub `user.name` and `user.email` are not listed or if no data returns, configure the properties:

.. Run this command to set your `user.name`, replacing `YourUserName` with your GitHub username:
+
[source,command]
----
git config –-global user.name "YourUserName"
----
.. Run this command to set your `user.email`, replacing `your@email.com` with your GitHub email address:
+
[source,command]
----
git config –-global user.email "your@email.com"
----
+
If two-factor authentication is enabled on your GitHub account and you are prompted for a password, enter your personal access token instead of your GitHub login password. For more information, see GitHub documentation https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa/accessing-github-using-two-factor-authentication[Access GitHub with 2FA^].

* If your GitHub `user.name` and `user.email` are listed, you are ready to use Git to control your project files from VS Code:

** <<create-repo, Use VS Code to create a repository for your project files in GitHub>>.
** <<add-remote, Connect your project to a existing repository in GitHub>>.
** <<push-changes, Push changes in your project to a connected repository in GitHub>>.

[[create-repo]]
== Create a Repository for Your Project from VS Code

If you do not have a repository for your project in GitHub, use VS Code to generate and publish your project files to the repository. If you already have a repository in GitHub that you intend to use for your project files, see <<add-remote>> to add the remote repository from VS Code. For other related processes, see the VS Code documentation at https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/sourcecontrol/intro-to-git[Introduction to Git in VS Code].

. Meet the prerequisites in <<prereqs>>.
//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
// Pointer to Source Control Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-source-control-no-edits"]
. In the Source Control panel, click *Publish to GitHub*.
+
image::start-scm-repo.png["Publish repository to GitHub from VS Code"]
+
When no repository is associated with your project, VS Code provides options for initializing a repository (*Initialize Repository*) or directly publishing your project to a new repository in GitHub (*Publish to GitHub*). 
. Provide a name for your repository in the field that opens, or use the default name that appears.
+
image::start-scm-repo-name.png["Name of new repository"]
+
The default repository name matches the project name.
. Select a repository type (private or public).
+
To protect data in your repository, select a private repository (*Publish to GitHub private repository*). This process commits and pushes your project files to your new repository.

. To view your project files in a GitHub repository, click *Open on GitHub* in the popup. 
+
image::start-scm-repo-open-in-github.png["Opening repository in GitHub"]
+
Alternatively, open GitHub from your browser and locate your new repository.

[[add-remote]]
== Publish to an Existing Repository on GitHub

To publish your project files for the first time from the IDE to an existing repository on GitHub, you must initialize your source files and connect from VS Code to the remote repository. This procedure assumes that the project files are ready to stage and publish to a repository in GitHub. 

. Meet the prerequisites in <<prereqs>>.
//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
// Pointer to Source Control Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-source-control-no-edits"]
. In the Source Control panel, click *Initialize Repository*.
+
When no repository is associated with your project, VS Code provides options for initializing a repository (*Initialize Repository*) or directly publishing your project to a new repository in GitHub (*Publish to GitHub*). 
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Configure a connection from the project in VS Code to your repository in GitHub:

.. Provide the following command to add the remote repository on GitHub:
+
[source, command]
----
Git: Add Remote...
----
.. Select *Git: Add Remote...* from the popup menu.
+
image::start-scm-repo-add-remote.png["Adding a remote repository from GitHub"]
.. Provide the URL to your git repository, for example:
+
image::start-scm-repo-add-remote-uri.png["Adding a remote repository URL from GitHub"]
.. Provide a name for the remote in VS Code, for example:
+
image::start-scm-repo-name-remote.png["Naming the remote repository"]
+
This name for the repository in VS Code can match or differ from the repository name in GitHub.
. From the Source Control panel, stage, commit, and publish your files to the repository in GitHub:

.. Stage your files by mousing over the *Changes* area (located after the *Commit* button) and clicking the image:icon-scm-add-changes.png["",15,15] (plus) icon.
+
image::start-scm-repo-stage-changes.png["Adding commit message for staged changes"]
+
The files move to the *Staged Changes* area. 
.. Provide your first commit message for the files before clicking *Commit*.
+
image::start-scm-repo-commit-staged.png["Commit message for staged changes"]   
.. Click *Publish Branch*.
+
image::start-scm-repo-publish-branch.png["Publish branch files in a repo on GitHub"]
. Open your repository in GitHub to review the published files, for example:
+

[[commit-source]]
== Sync Project File Changes with Your Repository 

After your project in VS Code is connected and published to a remote repository in GitHub, you can commit your push additional changes to the repository. If you do not have a repository for your project yet, see <<config-git>>. If you haven't added your repository to your project yet, see <<add-remote>>.

Use the VS Code UI or its built-in terminal to sync your changes:

* <<sync-from-ui>>
* <<sync-from-terminal>>

[[sync-from-ui]]
=== Sync Changes from the Source Control Panel 

To sync changes to your files from your project's Source Control panel in VS Code:

//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
// Pointer to Source Control Panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-source-control"]
. In the Source Control panel:
.. Stage your changes.
+
You can stage files individually or as a group.
.. Provide a commit message.
.. Click *Commit* to commit the changes to your local branch on the IDE.
.. Click *Sync Changes* to push your changes to your remote repository on GitHub.

[[sync-from-terminal]]
=== Sync Changes from the Command Terminal

To sync changes to your files from your project's command terminal in VS Code:

//step: open the project folder
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-open-packaged-sources.adoc[tag="open-workspace-root"]
//open ACB terminal:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
. At the prompt, run Git commands to add new files to your repository and to stage, commit, and push changes to your remote repository on GitHub.
+
The following example uses `git status` to check the status of changes, `git commit` to commit all changed files and add a commit message, and `git push` to merge the changes into the files on the remote repository.
+
----
$ git status
On branch main
Your branch is up to date with '011124-test-api-remote/main'.

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add <file>..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git restore <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
        modified:   011124-test-api.raml

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

== Clone the Repository for a Project

After adding a project to a repository on GitHub, you can clone it into your desktop or cloud IDE. Cloning is helpful for retrieving a backup of a deleted project or for sharing your project in another Anypoint Code Builder IDE. For example, you can work on the same project in the desktop and cloud IDE if your project is stored in a Git repository. 

//open ACB terminal:
include::anypoint-code-builder::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tag="open-terminal"]
. Navigate to your home directory for Anypoint Code Builder. 
. Clone your GitHub repository into your new directory:
+
[source,command]
----
git clone https://github.com/_yourusername_/_yourrepo_.git
----
. Open the project folder in the IDE.
