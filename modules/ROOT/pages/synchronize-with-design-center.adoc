Use the built-in integrated source control management (SCM) to sync American Flights API with Anypoint Design Center (Design Center). The Design Center SCM is built on Git.

== Before You Begin

If you haven't started the American Flight API specification, follow these procedures before attempting to synchronize:

. xref:tut-api-design-api-specification-from-scratch.adoc[]
. xref:tut-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]
. xref:tut-api-test-api-specification.adoc[]

== Review Changes in Files

Anypoint Code Builder highlights differences made in files since you last synced them with the main branch on Design Center.

When you change your API specification, the Source Control icon in the Activity Bar displays the number of changes to the API project. Click the icon to display details about your changes:

* *Changes*
* *Staged Changes*

//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::changes-and-staged-changes.png["Changes and Staged Changes highlighted in the source control section"]

To review your changes to your API specification:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your *Source Control* view using Ctrl+Shift+g (Mac) or Cmd+Shift+g (Windows).
. Open your `exchange.json` file.
. Review the working tree and notice the shading for deletions (red) and additions (green).
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::explore-changes-api-specification.png["exchange.json file highlighted to show the source control changes"]
+
In this case, you added some dependencies to the API by reusing API fragments you downloaded from Anypoint Exchange.
. Proceed to <<stage>> or <<stage-multiple-changes>> to stage your changes one at a time or together.

[[stage]]
== Stage Your Changes Individually

The UI uses the `git add` command to add a change from your working directory to the staging area. This area includes updates for the next commit. Anypoint Code Builder enables you to stage changes individually or as a group through the UI. 
//TODO: VERIFY HOW
Alternatively, you can use the embedded command line in Anypoint Code Builder to commit changes. 

To stage individual changes through the UI:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. Select the plus icon in the `american-flight-api.raml` file.
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::stage-american-flights-api.png["Source control number and plus icon of american-flight-api.raml file highlighted"]
. Review the changes in the Source Control section. The file moves into *Staged Changes*.
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic. Plus, take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::staged-changes.png["Working tree of american-flight-api.raml file highlighted"]
. Proceed to <<commit>>.

[[stage-multiple-changes]]
=== Stage Multiple Changes

Stage multiple files at the same time:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. Click the plus icon in the section header to stage the remaining changes.
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::stage-all-changes.png["Plus icon highlighted to stage all changes"]
+
Alternatively, you can perform these actions from the command line embedded in the IDE.
. Proceed to <<commit>>.

[[commit]]
== Commit Changes

The UI uses the `git commit` command to save the changes you staged to your local repository. 

To commit staged changes:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. Click in the message box.
. Enter a message that summarizes your changes.
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::add-commit-message.png["Message box highlighted"]
+
A good commit message helps summarize the changes across multiple files by multiple developers.
. Click the tick mark in the *Source Control* header to commit the changes.
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::commit-changes.png["Tick mark in the Source Control header highlighted"]
. Your Source Control view now displays no changes to commit.
. Proceed to <<push>>.

[[push]]
== Push Changes to Anypoint Design Center

The UI uses the `git push` command to upload your local content to Anypoint Design Center.

To push your changes:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select your Source Control view.
. Select the three dots that appear in the *Source Control* header.
. Select *Push*.
+
//TODO: Web IDE only because it contains hamburger menu. Need to make generic.
//TODO duke: fix/modify screenshot
image::push-changes.png["Push command highlighted in the source control section"]
+
Your changes are now published in Design Center.
+
The integrated SCM within Anypoint Code Builder might prompt you to `periodically run 'git fetch'`. This option enables Anypoint Code Builder to check for updates of your API in Design Center and prompt you to update your local version of the API.
