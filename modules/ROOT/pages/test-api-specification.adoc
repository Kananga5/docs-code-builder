Use the Mocking Service in the API Console to check the request and responses that you configured for American Flights API in xref:add-request-response-details.adoc[].

== Before You Begin

If you haven't started the American Flight API specification, follow these procedures before attempting to test:

. xref:tut-api-design-api-specification-from-scratch.adoc[]
. xref:tut-api-add-request-response-details.adoc[]

== Test Your API Specification

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your `american-flights-api.raml` file.
. Select the API Console icon in the editor toolbar.

//TODO: Take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
//TODO duke: try to fix width or retake 
. In API Console, select the `get` method for the `flights/` resource.

. Select the *Try It* button.

//TODO duke: try to fix width or retake 
. Select the *destination* text box inside *Query Parameters* and verify that the three values you defined in your API specification show up.

//TODO: Take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
//TODO duke: try to fix width or retake 
. Select *Send*.
. Verify that API Console returns the response you defined with the imported fragment.

Additionally, you can review your configured response examples when querying your mocked API endpoints.

. Proceed to xref:synchronize-with-design-center.adoc[]. 
+
Use the integrated source control management (SCM) to upload your API specification to Design Center so that other developers on your team can contribute to your API.
