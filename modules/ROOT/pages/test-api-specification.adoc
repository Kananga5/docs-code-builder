= Testing an API Specification Using Mocking Service

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"] 

With a designed API specification, you can use Mocking Service to mock your API and test the request and responses you designed in your API specification.

== Before You Begin

Before getting started, ensure you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Created a basic structure for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* Configured request and response data for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].

== Test Your API Specification

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your `american-flights-api.raml` file.
. Select the API Console icon in the editor toolbar.
+

//TO-DO: Take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
. In API Console, select the `get` method for the `flights/` resource.

//TO-DO: Take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
. Select the *Try It* button.

//TO-DO: Take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
. Select the *destination* text box inside *Query Parameters* and verify that the three values you defined in your API specification show up.

//TO-DO: Take a SS in a lower resolution, or only a part of the screen. Hi-res SS are hard to read in a 13 inch display.
. Select *Send*.
. Verify that API Console returns the response you defined with the imported fragment.

Additionally, you can review your configured response examples when querying your mocked API endpoints.
