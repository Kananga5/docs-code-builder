= Test an API Specification Using Mocking Service

With a designed API specification, you can use Mocking Service to mock your API and test
the request and responses you designed in your API specification.

== Before you Begin

Before getting started, ensure you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Created a basic structure for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].
* Configured request and response data for your API specification. +
See xref:design-api-specification.adoc[].

== Test your API Specification

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open your `american-flights-api.raml` file.
. Select the API Console icon on the top right of your screen.

. In API Console, select the `get` method for the `flights/` resource.

. Select the *Try It* button.

. Select the *destination* text box inside *Query Parameters* and verify that the three values you defined in your API specification show up.
+

. Select *Send*.
. Verify that API Console returns the response you defined with the imported fragment.

Additionally, you can review your configured response examples when querying your mocked API endpoints.
