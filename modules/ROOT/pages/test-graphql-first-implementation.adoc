= Test Your GraphQL Implementation

include::reuse::partial$beta-banner.adoc[tag="anypoint-code-builder"]

With a first scaffolded project, run your application locally and test the endpoints of your Mule application.

Note that because the GraphQL schema does not allow examples, Anypoint Code Builder scaffolds an empty project, so in this first run, your responses will be empty.

== Before You Begin

Before you begin, ensure that you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. +
See xref:setup.adoc[] for more information.
* Downloaded the xref:attachment$books-api.graphql[*Books API* GraphQL schema].
* Implemented the Books API GraphQL Schema. +
See xref:implement-a-graphql-api.adoc[Implement a GraphQL API].
* You installed a REST client like Postman or AdvancedRestClient.

== Run Your Application

To locally deploy your Mule Application, run a debug session in Anypoint Code Builder:

. Launch Anypoint Code Builder.
. Open the *Books Implementation* project.
. On your Run and Debug view, select your *Run and Debug* icon.
+
image::start-debugging.png[]
. Launch your browser Developer Tools (`F12`).
. Navigate to your *Application* tab, under *Storage* expanded the *Cookies* section, and select the URL of your web IDE instance.
+
image::application-storage-cookies.png[]
. Copy the cookie name and value. For example:
+
[source]
--
proxysession5f5648c7115f4e2e8f3f9396355ac4e8-0=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx
--
+
[NOTE]
--
The `proxysession` cookie name varies depending on the user.
--
. In Anypoint Code Builder, navigate to *View* > *Appearance* > *Panel* (`cmd + J` on macOS or `ctrl + J` on Windows).
. Navigate to the *Ports* tab.
. Copy the local address for port `8081`:
+
image::ports-panel-local-address-8081.png[]
+
[NOTE]
--
The URL to ping varies depending on the webIDE instance ID. It follows the format `+https://<web-IDE-instance>/proxy/<port-you-configured-on-your-listener>/+`. In this case, because you are pinging the 8081 port, your URL is `+https://<web-IDE-instance>/proxy/8081/+`.
See xref:ping-locally-deployed-app.adoc[] for more information.
--
. On your preferred REST client, create a `POST` request to the local address, adding the `/graphql` path: `+https://<web-IDE-instance>/proxy/8081/graphql+`.
. Add a new *Cookie* header to the request with the `proxysession` value:
+
[source,CURL]
--
--header 'Cookie: proxysession5f5648c7115f4e2e8f3f9396355ac4e8-0=xxxxxxxxxxxxxx \
--
+
image::send-request-with-cookies.png[]
. Configure the body of the request to contain a GraphQL query. For example:
+
[source,GraphQL]
--
query bookById($id: ID){
	bookById(id: $id) {
		id
		name
		pageCount
		author{
			id
			firstName
			lastName
		}
	}
}
--
+
Note that because you are querying a value by a specific ID (`$id: ID`), you must provide a GraphQL variable with the ID you want to query:
+
[source,GraphQL]
--
{
	"id": 1
}
--
+
image::graphql-query-book-by-id.png[]
. Send the request.
. Anypoint Code Builder returns an empty field for the book:
+
[source,GraphQL]
--
{
    "data": {
        "bookById": null
    }
}
--

Other queries you can try for your endpoint are:

* Query `books`:
+
[source,GraphQL]
--
query books {
	books{
		id
		name
		pageCount
		author{
			id
			firstName
			lastName
		}
	}
}
--
* Query `bestSellers`
+
[source,GraphQL]
--
query bestsellers {
	bestsellers{
		books{
			id
			name
			pageCount
			author{
				id
				firstName
				lastName
			}
		}
		authors{
			id
			firstName
			lastName
		}
	}
}
--

All these requests will return an empty result.

Populate each flow with a custom response for each query.
