Errors sometimes occur when you open an application in Anypoint Code Builder. 

== Loading Error in the UI Canvas

A *Loading...* error in the UI canvas of an open application typically indicates that a browser extension is interfering with the UI loading process. 

To address this issue, try:

* Disabling browser extensions and reloading the application 
* Using another browser that is not using extensions


== Canvas UI Renders Without Configured Flows or Subflows

If the UI canvas for an application that is already configured with a flow or subflow treats your application as a new project, prompting you with the question *What do you want to build in this file?* and *Flow* and *Sub flow* creation options, make sure that your application is open from its _root_ directory or from a multi-root workspace. 

Visual Studio Code treats a project directory as a workspace when you open it to the project's root directory or if your project folder is located in a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[multi-root workspace^].

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder...
----
. Navigate to the _root_ directory for your project. 
+
The root is the top-level folder that Anypoint Code Builder generates when it creates a project. Do not navigate to the projectâ€™s parent or ancestor directory or to one of its child or descendant directories.
