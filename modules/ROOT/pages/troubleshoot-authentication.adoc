Authentication errors sometimes occur in Anypoint Code Builder when you attempt to perform actions that require a connection to Anypoint Platform or to services that the cloud and desktop IDEs rely on. 

== Failed to Authenticate to Git

The error `Failed to authenticate to git remote` occurs if you select a different cloud region (EU Cloud or US Cloud) from the desktop IDE than your API specification project needs to synchronize your project in the Design Center SCM.

To address this issue, ensure that your IDE is set to the correct region for your project.
