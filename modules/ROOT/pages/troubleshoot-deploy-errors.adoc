In Anypoint Code Builder, the error `Failed to deploy to CloudHub: 400` occurs when you deploy a Mule application to CloudHub if the root organization or business group to which you are deploying lacks a sufficient vCore allocation. 

To address this isssue, increase the vCore allocation to the root organization or business group in the *Sandbox* environment:

* To reallocate resources, see xref:access-management::business-groups.adoc#redistribute-resources[Redistribute Resources Between Existing Business Groups]. 
* To manage environments, see xref:access-management::environments.adoc[]. For additional help, contact your organization administrator for Anypoint Platform.
