Errors sometimes occur when you open or start a project in Anypoint Code Builder. 

== Loading Error in the Application UI

A *Loading...* error in the UI of an open application typically indicates that a browser extension is interfering with the UI loading process.

To address this issue, try:

* Disabling browser extensions and reloading the application 
* Using another browser that is not using extensions


== Canvas UI Renders Without Configured Flows or Subflows

If the UI for an application that is already configured with a flow or subflow treats your application as a new project, prompting you with the question *What do you want to build in this file?* and *Flow* and *Sub flow* creation options, make sure that your application is open from its _root_ directory or from a multi-root workspace.

Visual Studio Code treats an open directory as a workspace. For the project to load into a workspace, the root directory of the project must be the top-level directory in the Explorer view, or the project must belong to a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[multi-root workspace^].

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder...
----
. Navigate to the _root_ directory for your project. 
+
The root is the top-level folder that Anypoint Code Builder generates when it creates a project. Do not navigate to the projectâ€™s parent or ancestor directory or to one of its child or descendant directories.

== Mule DX API Component was not installed

Wait for *Mule DX API Component was not installed* to disappear before retrying your action.

The error indicates that some Anypoint Code Builder dependencies have not finished loading. This issue typically occurs when you click *Design an API* and is often accompanied by the notification *Extracting Mule runtime: This operation may take a while...*. The extraction process can take several minutes, particularly after you install or update Anypoint Extension Pack on the desktop IDE.

You can monitor the progress of backend processes:

. Press Cmd+Shift+ (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) to open Output panel.
. Select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu in the panel.
