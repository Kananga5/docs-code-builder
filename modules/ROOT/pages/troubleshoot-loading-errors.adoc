Errors sometimes occur when you open or start a project in Anypoint Code Builder. 

== Loading Error in the Application UI

A *Loading...* error in the UI canvas often occurs under these conditions:

* When importing a project due to a missing dependency 
+
To check for a missing dependency:

//step open output panel
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-output-panel"]
. Select "Mule DX Server" from the drop-down menu.
. Search for an error caused by the missing dependency, similar to this one:
+
----
Caused by: org.eclipse.aether.transfer.ArtifactNotFoundException: 
Failure to find org.mule.examples:accelerator-common-config-module:jar:mule-plugin:1.1.0 
in https://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/ was cached in the local repository, 
resolution will not be reattempted until the update interval of central has 
elapsed or updates are forced
----
. If you find a missing dependency, log in to Anypoint Platform.
+
The canvas UI loads after all dependencies load.

* When a browser extension is interfering with the UI loading process  
+

+
To address this issue, try:
+
* Disabling browser extensions and reloading the application 
* Using another browser that is not using extensions

== Canvas UI Renders Without Configured Flows or Subflows

If the UI for an application that is already configured with a flow or subflow treats your application as a new project, prompting you with the question *What do you want to build in this file?* and *Flow* and *Sub flow* creation options, make sure that your application is open from its _root_ directory or from a multi-root workspace. 

image::acb-start-flow-subflow-ui.png["Start Screen Building a Mule Application"]

Visual Studio Code treats an open directory as a workspace. For the project to load into a workspace, the root directory of the project must be the top-level directory in the Explorer view, or the project must belong to a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[multi-root workspace^].

//step to open command palette:
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide this command:
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder...
----
. Navigate to the _root_ directory for your project. 
+
The root is the top-level folder that Anypoint Code Builder generates when it creates a project. Do not navigate to the projectâ€™s parent or ancestor directory or to one of its child or descendant directories.

== Mule DX API Component Was Not Installed

The error indicates that some Anypoint Code Builder dependencies have not finished loading. This issue typically occurs when you click *Design an API* and is often accompanied by the notification *Extracting Mule runtime: This operation may take a while...*. The extraction process can take several minutes, particularly after you install or update Anypoint Extension Pack on the desktop IDE.

. Wait for the error *Mule DX API Component was not installed* to disappear. 
. Retry your action.

To monitor the progress of backend processes:

//step to open output panel:
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-output-panel"]
. Select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu in the panel.
