== Mule DX API Component was not installed

If you receive the error *Mule DX API Component was not installed*, wait for background Anypoint Code Builder processes to complete. 

This issue typically occurs when you run *Design an API* and is often accompanied by the notification *Extracting Mule runtime: This operation may take a while...*.

To monitor the progress of backend processes:

. Press Cmd+Shift+ (Mac) or Ctrl+Shift+u (Windows) to open Output panel.
. Select *Mule DX Server* from the drop-down menu in the panel.
