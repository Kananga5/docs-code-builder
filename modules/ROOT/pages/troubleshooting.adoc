== Export Troubleshooting Information

If the MuleSoft support team requests troubleshooting information about your project, export a compressed file that contains your project's workspace folders, logs, and information about environment variables, CPU, operating system, and system properties.

//step to open command palette:
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide this command:
+
[source, command]
----
MuleSoft: Export Troubleshooting Information
----
. When you receive a notification about the information that the command extracts, click *Continue*. 
+
When the process is complete the IDE provides this message:
+
----
Collecting information...: Generating compressed file
----
. Click *Open folder* to locate the file. 
+
The command places the file in your home directory. The filename begins with the prefix `acb-troubleshooting`. For example, `/Users/me/acb-troubleshooting-w9ffppmq.tar.gz`.
. Provide a copy of the file to the support team.
