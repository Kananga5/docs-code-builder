Create an API specification that synchronizes your contacts database with Salesforce.

The synchronization API that you build contains a flow with the following logic:

. Fetch a contact from Salesforce.
. If the contact in Salesforce has a phone number, retrieve its first and last name.
. Define if the contact exists in the database by matching its first and last name with the contact fetched from Salesforce.
. If the contact in the database matches the contact on Salesforce, update the phone number in the Database and return a response indicating success.
+
Otherwise, create a response indicating that the contact doesn't exist.

== Create the API Specification

. In the cloud IDE instance, navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view:
+
image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png[]
. Click *Design an API*:
+
image::design-api-1.png[]
. Configure the API using the following values:
+
//TODO: CHECK IMAGE
image::design-api-ui-raml.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. Under *Project name*, type `Contact Sync`.
.. Under *Project Location*, click *Browse*, and then select your home directory.
.. Under *API Specification Language*, select *RAML 1.0*.
+
. Click *Create Project*.
+
The Explorer opens a project folder with a `contact-sync.raml` file in the editor.
. Select `contact-sync.raml` from the Explorer view:
+
image::select-contact-sync.png[]
. Paste the following RAML description to the API specification:

== Save Your Changes to Design Center

To enable collaboration on this API specification:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, select the Source Control view:
+
image::contact-sync-select-vcs.png[]
. Click the *Stage Changes* icon next to the `contact-sync.raml` file:
+
image::contact-sync-stage-changes.png[]

== Publish Your API to Exchange and Scaffold it

To write the logic behind this API, you must publish it to Exchange:

. In Anypoint Code Builder, open the `contact-sync.raml` file.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Publish API Specification to Exchange
----
+
image::publish-to-exchange.png[]
. If prompted, click *Allow*, and follow the prompts to sign in to Anypoint Platform.
. In *Select a Business Group*, find and select your business group for the project. 
+
For more information, see <<prereqs>>.
. Type a project name: *Contact Sync*.
. Confirm the asset version: *1.0.0*.
. Confirm the API version: *v1*.
+
The status bar shows the progress:
+
image::publishing-to-exchange-dialog.png[]
. Select *Yes* when prompted to scaffold the API dependency:
+
image::scaffold-option-yes.png[]
+
. Enter a name for the project: *contact-sync*.
. Select the directory in which to create the project:
+
image::select-project-location.png[]
+
Anypoint Code Builder adds the API specification as a dependency in the `pom.xml` file of your project and creates a new file called `contact-sync.xml`:
+
