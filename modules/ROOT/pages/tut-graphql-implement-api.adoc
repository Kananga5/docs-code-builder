Publish a GraphQL API schema to Anypoint Exchange. Then use Anypoint Code Builder to import and scaffold the schema into a Mule application. Run and implement the interface. 

== Before You Begin

Complete these procedures:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. 
See xref:start-acb.adoc[] for more information.
* Download the xref:attachment$books-api.graphql[*Books API* GraphQL schema].

== Publish the GraphQL API to Exchange

To implement a GraphQL API, the API must first be manually published to Exchange:

. Navigate to Anypoint Exchange, and sign in.
+
--
// Pointer to Exchange URLs
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="exchange-urls"]
--

. Click *Publish new asset*.
. For *Name*, type `books-api`.
. For *Asset types*, select *GraphQL API*.
. For *Method*, select *Upload a GraphQL API Schema*:
+
image::upload-graphql-api-exchange-method-select.png[]
+
. For *File upload*, click *Choose file* and browse for your `books-api.graphql` schema file.
. For *Lifecycle state*, select *Stable*.
. Click *Publish*.

== Implement the GraphQL API Schema

Use Anypoint Code Builder to retrieve the schema from Anypoint Exchange and scaffold the schema into an interface that you can implement from the desktop or cloud IDE.

. Open Anypoint Code Builder.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement an API Specification
----
. If prompted to sign in to Anypoint Platform, click *Allow*, and follow the prompts to sign in. 
. Configure your project using the following values:
// Use the table format?
+

+
[calloutlist]
.. *Project Name*: `books-implementation`
.. *Project Location*: click *Browse*, and then select your home directory.
.. Search for your *books-api* specification in Exchange by typing `books` and pressing Return to display the results. 
.. In the search results, hover over *books-api*, and click the *Add Asset* button that appears:
+
image::select-books-graphql-api.png[]
. In the *Implement an API Specification* form, click *Create Project*.
. If prompted, trust the authors of the API specification. 
+
Trusting is required working on the project from the IDE.
+
After you trust the authors, Anypoint Code Builder scaffolds your GraphQL API and creates a project with an empty flow for each type in your Books API GraphQL schema.

Each flow contains configurations for the elements `<graphqlrouter:data-fetcher/>`, `<set-payload/>`, and ` <graphqlrouter:serialize/>`.
The `<graphql-router:data-fetcher>` element serves as a trigger for a flow. See xref:apikit::apikit-graphql-api-mapping.adoc[] for more information about data fetchers.

. Proceed to xref:tut-graphql-test-first-implementation.adoc[] to run your application in Anypoint Code Builder and post GraphQL queries to your endpoint.
