This tutorial guides you through creating a Mule application from scratch, implementing a GraphQL API that you publish to Exchange.

== Before You Begin

Complete these procedures:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment. 
See xref:start-acb.adoc[] for more information.
* Download the xref:attachment$books-api.graphql[*Books API* GraphQL schema].

== Publish the GraphQL API to Exchange

To implement a GraphQL API, the API must first be manually published to Exchange:

. Navigate to Anypoint Exchange.
+
--
// Pointer to Exchange URLs
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="exchange-urls"]
--

. Click *Publish new asset*.
. For *Name*, type `books-api`.
. For *Asset types*, select *GraphQL API*.
. For *Method*, select *Upload a GraphQL API Schema*:
+
image::upload-graphql-api-exchange-method-select.png[]
+
. For *File upload*, click *Choose file* and browse for your `books-api.graphql` schema file.
. For *Lifecycle state*, select *Stable*.
. Click *Publish*.

== Implement the GraphQL API

. Navigate to Anypoint Code Builder.
// Pointer to Command Palette
include::partial$acb-reusable-steps.adoc[tags="open-command-palette"]
. Provide this command:
+
[source,command]
----
MuleSoft: Implement an API Specification
----
+
. Select the command.
+
// . In the cloud IDE instance, navigate to your Anypoint Code Builder view:
// +
//TODO: cc: I wonder if we need this screenshot?
// image::anypoint-code-builder-view.png[]
// . Select *Implement an API*.
// +
//TODO: cc: I wonder if we need this screenshot?
// image::implement-api-option-mat.png[]
. Configure your project using the following values:
// Use the table format?
+
image::implement-api-configure-in-task.png[]
+
[calloutlist]
.. *Project Name*: `books-implementation`
.. *Project Location*: click *Browse*, and then select your home directory.
+
//TODO: cc: I wonder if we need this screenshot? The step seems self-explantory without one. Plus, the screenshot differs from the desktop IDE UI.
// image::select-home-directory.png[]
+
.. Search for an API specification published in Exchange to implement. +
Start typing `books` and press Return to display a list of possible results. Click *Add Asset* for the *books-api* asset:
+
image::select-books-graphql-api.png[]
+
. Click *Create Project*.
+
// TODO: cc: Desktop IDE prompted me to save a `.code-workspace` file here. Is this correct behavior?
Anypoint Code Builder scaffolds your GraphQL API and creates an empty flow for each type in your Books API GraphQL schema.

type Query {
  bookById(id: ID): Book
  books: [Book]
  bestsellers: Bestsellers
}

type Book {
  id: ID!
  name: String
  pageCount: Int
  author: Author
}

type Author {
  id: ID!
  firstName: String
  lastName: String
}

type Bestsellers {
  books: [Book]
  authors: [Author]
}

<flow name="Query.bookById"/>
<flow name="Query.books"/>
<flow name="Query.bestsellers"/>
<flow name="Book.author"/>
<flow name="Bestsellers.books"/>
<flow name="Bestsellers.authors"/>
--

Anypoint Code Builder also creates a `<graphql-router:data-fetcher>` as sources for each of your Mule flows. See xref:apikit::apikit-graphql-api-mapping.adoc[] for more information about data fetchers.

. Proceed to xref:tut-graphql-test-first-implementation.adoc[] to run your application in Anypoint Code Builder and post GraphQL queries to your endpoint.
