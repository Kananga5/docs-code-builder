Create an integration that notifies you through email or Slack when a new case is created in Salesforce.

The integration that you build contains a flow with the following logic:

* The creation of a new case in Salesforce triggers your flow.
* If the case is escalated, your application sends an email to the regional leader including the case number, origin, reason, priority, and status.
* If the case is not escalated, your application sends a message to a Slack channel with the same information.

== Before You Begin

Before you begin, ensure you:

* Set up your MuleSoft environment.
+
See xref:start-acb.adoc[] for more information.
* Set up a Salesforce demo environment.
** https://developer.salesforce.com/signup[Sign up for a developer organization^].
**  https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.user_security_token.htm&type=5[Create a developer security token^].
* Have a personal or business Gmail account.
* Have a personal or business Slack account.

=== Set Up Your Slack Workspace

. Navigate to https://slack.com/[Slack^] and log in using your organization credentials.
+
If your work organization restricts users from creating new workspaces, log in using your personal email account.
. Create a new Workspace called "Integration Test".
. Skip the step to invite new users and type a brief description of your Workspace, for example, "This is a test Workspace".
. Navigate to https://api.slack.com/apps[Your Apps^] and click *Create an App*:
+
image::slack-create-app.png[]
. Select *From scratch*.
. Name your app "OAuth for Anypoint Code Builder", and select your *Integration Test* workspace.
. Click *Generate*:
+

. Click *Permission scope*:
+
image::slack-install-permission-scope.png[]
. Scroll down to the *Scopes* section and, under *Bot Token Scopes*, select *Add an OAuth Scope*, and select *chat:write.public*:
+
image::slack-bot-permissions-chat-write.png[]
. Select *Add scopes* when prompted to add other necessary scopes for `chat:write.public`.
. Scroll up to the *OAuth Tokens for Your Workspace* and select *Install to Workspace*.
. Click *Allow*:
+
image::slack-allow-install-app-workspace.png[]
. Under *Bot User OAuth Token*, click *Copy* and save it on a safe location.
+
image::slack-copy-oauth-token.png[]
+
You use this token to connect to your Slack workspace from Anypoint Code Builder:
+
. Create a new public channel called "this-is-a-test" in your *Integration Test* workspace.
. Add the OAuth for Anypoint Code Builder app to the `this-is-a-test` channel.

=== Set up an App Password for Your Email

Later in this tutorial, you configure the Email Connector to send emails to your configured email account. To avoid using your email password, follow https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833?visit_id=637917932546436561-2352829986&p=InvalidSecondFactor&rd=1[Google instructions^] to configure an App password.

IMPORTANT: The Gmail account must have 2-factor authentication enabled to configure an App password.
