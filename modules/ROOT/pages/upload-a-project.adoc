Import a project directory or a packaged Mule application (JAR file) to Anypoint Code Builder.

== Load a Project Directory or Project File into the Desktop IDE

The desktop IDE opens your local file directory. You can navigate to the project folder or directory that you intend to load to the IDE.

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder...
----
. Navigate to the _root_ directory for your project. 
+
This directory is the folder that Anypoint Code Builder generates when you create a project. The project folder contains an API specification, implementation, or integration application. 
. Open the root directory for your project.
+
If you do not open the root directory, the project does not load correctly to Visual Studio Code.

== Upload a Project Directory to the Web IDE

. Open the Command Palette by pressing Ctrl+Shift+p (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+p (Mac), and provide the following command:
+
[source,command]
----
File: Open Folder...

+
image::file-open-folder-command.png[]
. Select your Anypoint Code Builder home directory:
+
image::select-home-directory.png[]
+
You may need to trust the authors of the files in the directory if this is your first time opening your home directory:
+
image::trust-home-directory.png[]
. After Anypoint Code Builder loads your home directory, drag your project directory to your Explorer view:
+
image::drag-folder-explorer.png[]
