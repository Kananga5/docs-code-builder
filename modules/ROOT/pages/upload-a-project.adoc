A project directory contains an API specification or Mule application for an implementation or integration. 

== Import a Project Folder or Compressed Project File into the Desktop IDE

The desktop IDE enables you to upload a project directory or JAR file into a workspace:

Visual Studio Code treats a project directory as a workspace when you open it to the root directory or if your project folder is within a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[multi-root workspace^].

== Use DataWeave with Imported Projects

To use DataWeave in an imported project, a `mule-service-weave-ee` dependency must be configured in your project `pom.xml` file, for example:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.services</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-service-weave-ee</artifactId>
  <version>2.4.0-20220824</version>
  <scope>runtime</scope>
</dependency>
