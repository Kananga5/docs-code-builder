Import a project directory or a packaged project into a workspace in your IDE. A project directory contains an API specification or a Mule application for an implementation or integration. 

Visual Studio Code treats a project directory as a workspace when you open it to the project's root directory or if your project folder is located in a https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/multi-root-workspaces[multi-root workspace^]. 

To _export_ a JAR file that packages a project with resources from your application, see xref:package-mule-application.adoc[].

If you encounter an import issue, check for workarounds in xref:acb-release-notes.adoc#import-issues[Known Issues] in the Anypoint Code Builder Release Notes or in xref:troubleshooting.adoc[].

=== Import a Sharable Project JAR File

Import a sharable JAR file into the IDE.

Shareable JAR files are generated through the process described in xref:package-mule-application.adoc#sharable[Package a Project in a Sharable JAR File] and are different from xref:package-mule-application.adoc#archivable[other lightweight JAR files] created for archive purposes.

== Use DataWeave with Imported Projects

To use DataWeave in an imported project, a `mule-service-weave-ee` dependency must be configured in your project `pom.xml` file, for example:

[source,XML]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>com.mulesoft.services</groupId>
  <artifactId>mule-service-weave-ee</artifactId>
  <version>2.4.0-20220824</version>
