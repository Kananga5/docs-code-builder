When working with your web IDE, Anypoint Code Builder stores all your projects in your home directory by default.

To create different folders to store your projects within your home directory:

. Open the Command Palette (`ctrl/cmd + shift + P`) and type _File: Open Folder..._.

You may need to trust the authors of the files in the directory if this is your first time opening your home directory:

. After Anypoint Code Builder loads your home directory, right-click on your Explorer view, and select *New Folder*.

Optionally, you can create new folders using your terminal:

. Ensure that you don't have any projects open.
. Open the Terminal window (`ctrl + ``).
. Type the following command:
+
[source]
--
mkdir <name-of-your-folder>
--
+
Replace `<name-of-your-folder>` with whatever name you want to give to this directory.
