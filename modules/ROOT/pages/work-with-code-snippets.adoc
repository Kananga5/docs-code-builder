//TODO: IS THS UP-TO-DATE?
//TODO: CAN'T SEE IMAGES

To reuse code patterns in configuration files for your Mule application flows or subflows, use built-in snippets or define your own user snippets. These practices avoid the need to retype the same pattern each time you use it, which helps you work more efficiently and reduces the potential for configuration errors. 

Use snippets to provide configurations for any elements supported by the Mule DSL, such as commonly used connector operations, message processing patterns supported by other components, or multi-element configurations in the configuration XML.

Snippets are templates created in the JSON format. When you insert a snippet into the configuration XML for a Mule application flow, the snippet JSON transforms to XML automatically. Create user snippets in `mule-xml.json`. Code snippets are a VS Code feature. For more information, see https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/userdefinedsnippets[Snippets in Visual Studio Code^].

//TODO: WHAT DOES THIS MEAN?? 
Anypoint Code Builder does not filter out snippets for code that goes outside a flow, such as connector configurations.

== Built-In Snippets

Anypoint Code Builder bundles a set of built-in snippets. To add a built-in snippet to your flow:

. From the canvas for a Mule application, select the `plus` to add a new component to your flow.
+
image::main-tutorial-add-first-http-listener.png["Mule application canvas"]
. Navigate to *Snippets* > *Built-in Snippets*. 
. Select a snippet for your flow from the list of built-in snippets.
+
The IDE inserts XML for the snippet within the `<flow/>` element of your application at the location you selected from the canvas.

Alternatively, use the auto-complete feature (Ctrl+shift or Cmd+shift) within the configuration XML to find built-in snippets. For example:

image::acb-auto-complete-options.png["Auto-completion options for the Choice router"]


Compare the built-in Choice snippet configuration to the basic XML configuration for this component:

[source,xml]
--
<!-- (1) -->
<choice doc:name="Choice" doc:id="vcfaqr" >
  <when expression='#[]' doc:name="When" >
  </when>
  <otherwise doc:name="Otherwise" >
  </otherwise>
</choice>
<!-- (2) -->
<choice doc:name="Choice" doc:id="hhdehz" >
--

<1> XML for the built-in Choice snippet, identified as `flow:choice` in the auto-complete list. The icon for snippets is a two-dimensional square. 
<2> XML for the minimally configured Choice component. The icon for minimally configured XML is a three-dimensional square. For built-in _components_ like the Choice router, the IDE inserts the same configuration XML block when you navigate to *Core Processors* > *Flow Control* > *Choice* from the canvas.

== Create a User Snippet

Create reusable user snippets for your Mule applications. 

Snippets that you create are specific to your IDE instance and not shared in projects for applications that you export for others to import and work on.

To create a snippet:

. From the canvas for a Mule application, select the `plus` to add a new component to your flow.
+
image::main-tutorial-add-first-http-listener.png["Mule application canvas"]
. Navigate to *Snippets* > *User Snippets*. 
+
If the snippet you need is not available, you can use the *+* icon in the *User Snippets* UI to open `mule-xml.json`, where you configure user snippets. If you have no snippets, Anypoint Code Builder creates a new `mule-xml.json` snippet file with a sample snippet for you to edit.
+
For example, if your `mule-xml.json` is not configured yet, uncomment all the fields after *Example*:
+
[source,JSON]
--
{
    // Example:
	  "Log a message": { //<!--<1>-->
	 	"prefix": "log", //<!--<2>-->
	 	"body": [ //<!--<3>-->
	 		"<logger level=\"${1:INFO}\" message='$2' doc:name=\"Logger\" doc:id=\"$RANDOM_HEX\" />$0",
	 	],
	 	"description": "Log output to console" //<!--<4>-->
	 }
}
--
<1> The first element in the XML is the text that displays in the list of user snippets.
<2> The `prefix` field is the trigger text for that snippet. Start typing the prefix and press `tab` in your XML editor to add the snippet using auto-complete.
<3> The `body` field is the actual code template that you can reuse.
<4> The `description` field is a description of the snippet.
+
After you save the new snippet, select the new snippet from the canvas to load the configuration XML for your application, the XML for the logger example looks like this:
+
[source,xml]
----
<logger level="" message='$2' doc:name="Logger" doc:id="sgxbfo" />
----
+
In this example, notice that `doc:id` is a randomly generated because of the `$RANDOM_HEX` value in the snippet.
+
. Add any required values or configurations to the XML.
+
In the example, the next step is to add a `level` and `message` value to the component. For example:
+
[source,xml]
----
<logger level="WARN" message='my message here' doc:name="Logger" doc:id="sgxbfo" />
----
. Add any other snippets to your `mule-xml.json` by adding new fields. For example:
+
[source,JSON]
--
{
    // Example:
	 "Log a message": {
	 	"prefix": "log",
	 	"body": [
	 		"<logger level=\"${1:INFO}\" message='$2' doc:name=\"Logger\" doc:id=\"$RANDOM_HEX\" />$0",
	 	],
	 	"description": "Log output to console"
	 },
        "Select first and last name from database": { //<!--<1>-->
          "prefix": "select-name-from-db",
          "body": [
            "<db:select config-ref=\"${1:Database_Config}\" doc:name=\"${2:Select Contact from DB}\" doc:id=\"$RANDOM_HEX\" >",
            "<db:sql>",
            "<![CDATA[SELECT * FROM Contacts WHERE FirstName = :firstname AND LastName = :lastname]]>",
            "</db:sql>",
            "<db:input-parameters>",
              "<![CDATA[#[\\{",
              "firstname: vars.firstnameVar,",
              "lastname: vars.lastnameVar",
              "\\}]]]>",
            "</db:input-parameters>",
            "</db:select>$0"
		],
		"description": "Pull first and last name from database"
	 }
}
--
<1> A snippet for a Database Connector select operation that retrieves `firstName` and `lastName` values from a Database.
+
If you insert the snippet for the database example into your configuration XML, the next step is to provide the value of `config-ref=""`. To get the value, it is necessary to configure a global `<db:config/>` element at outside of the `<flow/>`. To learn more about this configuration, see xref:connect-to-a-db.adoc[].
+
Like built-in snippets, user snippets are also available from the auto-complete menu in the configuration XML. In the auto-complete menu, find the name for the snippet (configured in `mule-xml.json`), and insert the XML configuration for the snippet into an application flow.
